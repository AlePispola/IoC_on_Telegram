"The actors behind LUCKY ELEPHANT recognize the effectiveness and use doppelganger webpages nearly identical to legitimate sites , enticing users to input their credentials . The heavier targeting in Pakistan adheres to historical targeting and the ongoing tension between the two countries , which has escalated since a terrorist attack in Kashmir on 14 February 2019 . The targeting of Pakistan , Bangladesh , Sri Lanka , Maldives , Myanmar , Nepal , and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization are all historical espionage targets by India . However , it is clear is that Donot are actively establishing infrastructure and are targeting governments in South Asia . First attack of this campaign took place in May 2018 . Arbor also published APT research on this group , and named it ‘Donot’ . Donot attacked government agencies , aiming for classified intelligence . We identified this APT group coded as ‘APT-C-35’ in 2017 , who is mainly targeting Pakistan and other South Asian countries for Cyber Espionage . At least 4 attack campaigns against Pakistan have been observed by us since 2017 . Spear phishing emails with vulnerable Office documents or malicious macros are sent to victims . In the latest attack , Donot group is targeting Pakistani businessman working in China . Two unique malware frameworks , EHDevel and yty , are developed by attackers . wuaupdt.exe is a CMD backdoor , which can receive and execute CMD commands sent from C2 . Furthermore , it has similar code logic as previous ones wuaupdt.exe in this attack appears in previous Donot attack , and C2 addresses are same to previous ones . From the attack activity captured this time , it is obvious that Donot APT group is still keen on Pakistan as primary target of attack , and even expands scope of attack to include Pakistani staffs and institutions in China . Buhtrap still make extensive use of NSIS installers as droppers and these are mainly delivered through malicious documents . They first came to light in 2016 , when they managed to steal sensitive information from the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) . Earworm first came to light in 2016 , when they managed to steal sensitive information from the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) . They were also behind an attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) , in which they leaked confidential information about several drug tests . SPLM , GAMEFISH , and Zebrocy delivery all maintain their own clusters , but frequently overlap later . Our previous post on Sofacy's 2017 activity stepped aACT from the previously covered headline buzz presenting their association with previously known political hacks and interest in Europe and the US , and examines their under-reported ongoing activity in middle east , central asia , and now a shift in targeting further east , including China , along with an overlap surprise . The larger , 300kb+ SPLM backdoors deployed in 2016 and 2017 are not observed any longer at targets in 2018 . A previous , removed , report from another vendor claimed non-specific information about the groups' interest in Chinese universities , but that report has been removed – most likely detections were related to students’ and researchers’ scanning known collected samples and any incidents” remain unconfirmed and unknown . Either ACT , the group's consistent activity throughout central and eastern asia seems to be poorly represented in the public discussion . The actors behind this campaign we call LUCKY ELEPHANT use doppelganger webpages to mimic legitimate entities such as foreign governments , telecommunications , and military . Currently , Sofacy targets large air-defense related commercial organizations in China with SPLM , and moves Zebrocy focus across Armenia , Turkey , Kazahkstan , Tajikistan , Afghanistan , Mongolia , China , and Japan . Either ACT , Sofacy's consistent activity throughout central and eastern asia seems to be poorly represented in the public discussion . According to this new alert , Hidden Cobra the U.S. government’s code name for Lazarus has been conducting FASTCash attacks stealing money from Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) from banks in Asia and Africa since at least 2016 . Lazarus is a very active attack group involved in both cyber crime and espionage . The group was initially known for its espionage operations and a number of high-profile disruptive attacks , including the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures . Following US-CERTs report , Symantec's research uncovered the key component used in Lazarus's recent wave of financial attacks . More recently , Lazarus has also become involved in financially motivated attacks , including an US$81 million dollar theft from the Bangladesh Central Bank and the WannaCry ransomware . Other open source and semi-legitimate pen-testing tools like nbtscan and powercat are being used for mapping available resources and lateral movement as well . To make the fraudulent withdrawals , Lazarus first breaches targeted banks' networks and compromises the switch application servers handling ATM transactions . The operation , known as FASTCash” has enabled Lazarus to fraudulently empty ATMs of cash . In order to permit their fraudulent withdrawals from ATMs , Lazarus inject a malicious Advanced Interactive eXecutive (AIX) executable into a running , legitimate process on the switch application server of a financial transaction network , in this case a network handling ATM transactions . It was previously believed that the attackers used scripts to manipulate legitimate software on the server into enabling the fraudulent activity . In recent years , Lazarus has also become involved in financially motivated attacks . This malware in turn intercepts fraudulent Lazarus cash withdrawal requests and sends fake approval responses , allowing the attackers to steal cash from ATMs . Lazarus was linked to the $81 million theft from the Bangladesh central bank in 2016 , along with a number of other bank heists . Lazarus was also linked to the WannaCry ransomware outbreak in May 2017 . WannaCry incorporated the leaked EternalBlue exploit that used two known vulnerabilities in Windows CVE-2017-0144 and CVE-2017-0145 to turn the ransomware into a worm , capable of spreading itself to any unpatched computers on the victim's network and also to other vulnerable computers connected to the internet . Lazarus was initially known for its involvement in espionage operations and a number of high-profile disruptive attacks , including the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures that saw large amounts of information being stolen and computers wiped by malware . In short , Lazarus continues to pose a serious threat to the financial sector and organizations should take all necessary steps to ensure that their payment systems are fully up to date and secured . As with the 2016 series of virtual bank heists , including the Bangladesh Bank heist , FASTCash illustrates that Lazarus possesses an in-depth knowledge of banking systems and transaction processing protocols and has the expertise to leverage that knowledge in order to steal large sums from vulnerable banks . The attack , which starts with a malicious attachment disguised as a top secret US document , weaponizes TeamViewer , the popular remote access and desktop sharing software , to gain full control of the infected computer . As described in the infection flow , one of the first uses of the AutoHotKey scripts is to upload a screenshot from the compromised PC . It is hard to tell if there are geopolitical motives behind this campaign by looking solely at the list of countries it was targeting , since it was not after a specific region and the victims came from different places in the world . The initial infection vector used by the threat actor also changed over time , during 2018 we have seen multiple uses of self-extracting archives instead of malicious documents with AutoHotKey , which displayed a decoy image to the user . The recent wave of FASTCash attacks demonstrates that financially motivated attacks are not simply a passing interest for the Lazarus group and can now be considered one of its core activities . Although both examples of the different delivery methods described above show an exclusive targeting of Russian speakers , the recurring financial and political themes that they use highlight the attacker's interest in the financial world once more . Throughout our investigation , we have found evidence that shows operational similarities between this implant and Gamaredon Group . Gamaredon Group is an alleged Russian threat group . Gamaredon Group has been active since at least 2013 , and has targeted individuals likely involved with the Ukrainian government . EvilGnome's functionalities include desktop screenshots , file stealing , allowing capturing audio recording from the user’s microphone and the ability to download and execute further modules . Gamaredon Group primarily makes use of Russian hosting providers in order to distribute its malware . Gamaredon Group's implants are characterized by the employment of information stealing tools — among them being screenshot and document stealers delivered via a SFX , and made to achieve persistence through a scheduled task . Gamaredon Group infects victims using malicious attachments , delivered via spear phishing techniques . The techniques and modules employed by EvilGnome — that is the use of SFX , persistence with task scheduler and the deployment of information stealing tools—remind us of Gamaredon Group’s Windows tools . We can observe that the sample is very recent , created on Thursday , July 4 . As can be observed in the illustration above , the makeself script is instructed to run ./setup.sh after unpacking . The ShooterAudio module uses PulseAudio to capture audio from the user's microphone . makeself.sh is a small shell script that generates a self-extractable compressed tar archive from a directory . During our 2018 monitoring of this group , we were able to identify different techniques utilized by very similar attackers in the MENA region , sometimes on the same target . Gaza Cybergang Group3 (highest sophistication) whose activities previously went by the name Operation Parliament . Gaza Cybergang has been seen employing phishing , with several chained stages to evade detection and extend command and control server lifetimes . The most popular targets of SneakyPastes are embassies , government entities , education , media outlets , journalists , activists , political parties or personnel , healthcare and banking . Through our continuous monitoring of threats during 2018 , we observed a new wave of attacks by Gaza Cybergang Group1 targeting embassies and political personnel . Gaza Cybergang Group1 is an attack group with limited infrastructure and an open-source type of toolset , which conducts widespread attacks , but is nevertheless focused on Palestinian political problems . In this campaign , Gaza Cybergang used disposable emails and domains as the phishing platform to target the victims . The RAT , however , had a multitude of functionalities (as listed in the table below) such as to download and execute , compress , encrypt , upload , search directories , etc . We expect the damage caused by these groups to intensify and the attacks to extend into other regions that are also linked to the complicated Palestinian situation . Cylance determined that the ‘Ghost Dragon’ group utilized specifically tailored variants of Gh0st RAT , which the group modified from the 3.6 version of the source code released in 2008 . The standard network protocol for Gh0st RAT 3.6 employs zlib compression , which utilizes ‘Gh0st’ as a static five-byte packet flag that must be included in the first five bytes of initial transmission from the victim . In a more recent version of the modified Gh0st RAT malware , Ghost Dragon implemented dynamic packet flags which change the first five bytes of the header in every login request with the controller . SPEAR has observed numerous different XOR keys utilized by Ghost Dragon . exploit and tools continued to be used after Buckeye's apparent disappearance in 2017 . The Buckeye attack group was using Equation Group tools to gain persistent access to target organizations at least a year prior to the Shadow Brokers leak . Buckeye's use of Equation Group tools also involved the exploit of a previously unknown Windows zero-day vulnerability . While Buckeye appeared to cease operations in mid-2017 , the Equation Group tools it used continued to be used in attacks until late 2018 . The 2017 leak of Equation Group tools by a mysterious group calling itself the Shadow Brokers was one of the most significant cyber security stories in recent years. However , Symantec has now found evidence that the Buckeye Cyber Espionage group (aka APT3 , Gothic Panda ) began using Equation Group tools in attacks at least a year prior to the Shadow Brokers leak . Equation is regarded as one of the most technically adept espionage groups and the release of a trove of its tools had a major impact , with many attackers rushing to deploy the malware and exploits disclosed . DoublePulsar was delivered to victims using a custom exploit tool (Trojan.Bemstour) that was specifically designed to install DoublePulsar . One vulnerability is a Windows zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-0703) discovered by Symantec . Bemstour exploits two Windows vulnerabilities in order to achieve remote kernel code execution on targeted computers .",1,"The actors behind LUCKY ELEPHANT recognize the effectiveness and use doppelganger webpages nearly identical to legitimate sites , enticing users to input their credentials .

"The Emissary Panda threat group loaded the China Chopper webshell onto SharePoint servers at two Government organizations in the Middle East , which we believe with high confidence involved exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in SharePoint tracked in CVE-2019-0604 . The files uploaded to this webshell included the same compiled python script that would scan remote systems that were vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144 ( EternalBlue ) that we saw uploaded to the other errr.aspx webshell . According to Microsoft’s advisory , this vulnerability was patched on March 12 , 2019 and we first saw the webshell activity on April 1 , 2019 . We believe the actors pivoted to other systems on the network using stolen credentials and by exploiting the CVE-2017-0144 ( EternalBlue ) vulnerability patched in MS17-010 . Once the adversary established a foothold on the targeted network , they used China Chopper and other webshells to upload additional tools to the SharePoint server to dump credentials , perform network reconnaissance and pivot to other systems . We also observed Emissary Panda uploading legitimate tools that would sideload DLLs , specifically the Sublime Text plugin host and the Microsoft’s Create Media application , both of which we had never seen used for DLL sideloading before . Consequently , the Linux malware ecosystem is plagued by financial driven crypto-miners and DDoS botnet tools which mostly target vulnerable servers . We also observed the actors uploading legitimate tools that would sideload DLLs , specifically the Sublime Text plugin host and the Microsoft’s Create Media application , both of which we had never seen used for DLL sideloading before . It has been active since at least 2013 , and has targeted individuals likely involved with the Ukrainian government . The group’s implants are characterized by the employment of information stealing tools among them being screenshot and document stealers delivered via a SFX , and made to achieve persistence through a scheduled task . The finding shows that EvilGnome operates on an IP address that was controlled by the Gamaredon group two months ago . FIN7 operations are linked to numerous intrusion attempts having targeted hundreds of companies since at least as early as 2015 . The FIN7 intrusion set continued its tailored spear phishing campaigns throughout last year . In addition , during the investigation , we discovered certain similarities to other attacker groups that seemed to share or copy the FIN7 TTPs in their own operations . In 2018-2019 , researchers of Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team analyzed various campaigns that used the same Tactics Tools and Procedures (TTPs) as the historic FIN7 , leading the researchers to believe that this threat actor had remained active despite the 2018 arrests . One of the domains used by FIN7 in their 2018 campaign of spear phishing contained more than 130 email APTes , leading us to think that more than 130 companies had been targeted by the end of 2018 . Interestingly , following some open-source publications about them , the FIN7 operators seems to have developed a homemade builder of malicious Office document using ideas from ThreadKit , which they employed during the summer of 2018 . The first module downloaded by the GRIFFON malware to the victim’s computer is an information-gathering JScript , which allows the cybercriminals to understand the context of the infected workstation . The new GRIFFON implant is written to the hard drive before each execution , limiting the file-less” aspect of this method . Given FIN7’s previous use of false security companies , we decided to look deeper into this one . This activity cluster , which Kaspersky Lab has followed for a few years , uses various implants for targeting mainly banks , and developers of banking and money processing software solutions . FIN7’s last campaigns were targeting banks in Europe and Central America . After a successful penetration , FIN7 uses its own backdoors and the CobaltStrike framework or Powershell Empire components to hop to interesting parts of the network , where it can monetize its access . AveMaria is a new botnet , whose first version we found in September 2018 , right after the arrests of the FIN7 members . This threat actor stole suspected of stealing €13 million from Bank of Valetta , Malta earlier this year . In fact , AveMaria is a classic infostealer bot that collects all possible credentials from various types of software: browsers , email clients , messengers , etc. , and can act as a keylogger . They also use AutoIT droppers , password-protected EXE files and even ISO images . To deliver their malware , the cyber criminals use spearphishing emails with various types of attachments: MS Office documents or spreadsheet files exploiting some known vulnerability like CVE-2017-11882 , or documents with Ole2Link and SCT . Interestingly , this actor targeted financial entities and companies in one African country , which lead us to think that CopyPaste was associated with cybermercenaries or a training center . At the end of 2018 , while searching for new FIN7 campaigns via telemetry , we discovered a set of activity that we temporarily called CopyPaste” from a previously unknown APT . FIN7 and Cobalt used decoy 302 HTTP redirections too , FIN7 on its GRIFFON C2s before January 2018 , and Cobalt , on its staging servers , similar to CopyPaste . Quite recently , FIN7 threat actors typosquatted the brand Digicert” using the domain name digicert-cdn[.]com , which is used as a command and control server for their GRIFFON implants . The first of them is the well-known FIN7 , which specializes in attacking various companies to get access to financial data or PoS infrastructure . The second one is CobaltGoblin Carbanak EmpireMonkey , which uses the same toolkit , techniques and similar infrastructure but targets only financial institutions and associated software/services providers . we observe , with various level of confidence , that there are several interconnected groups using very similar toolkits and the same infrastructure to conduct their cyberattacks . The last piece is the newly discovered CopyPaste group , who targeted financial entities and companies in one African country , which lead us to think that CopyPaste was associated with cybermercenaries or a training center . At the end of 2018 , the cluster started to use not only CobaltStrike but also Powershell Empire in order to gain a foothold on the victims’ networks . FIN7 thus continues to use effective spearphishing campaigns in conjunction with well-known MS Office exploits generated by the framework . MuddyWater is widely regarded as a long-lived APT group in the Middle East . From February to April 2019 , MuddyWater launched a series of spear-phishing attacks against governments , educational institutions , financial , telecommunications and defense companies in Turkey , Iran , Afghanistan , Iraq , Tajikistan and Azerbaijan . FIN7 thus continue to use effective spearphishing campaigns in conjunction with well-known MS Office exploits generated by the framework . We also unearthed and detailed our other findings on MuddyWater , such as its connection to four Android malware variants and its use of false flag techniques , among others , in our report New MuddyWater Activities Uncovered: Threat Actors Used Multi-Stage Backdoors , False Flags , Android malware , and More . Instead , the campaign used compromised legitimate accounts to trick victims into installing malware . Notably , the group’s use of email as infection vector seems to yield success for their campaigns . We also observed MuddyWater’s use of multiple open source post-exploitation tools , which they deployed after successfully compromising a target . The attacker also connected to the compromised servers from IP addresses that were linked to dynamic domain names used as C&Cs by the delivered payloads . The main payload is usually Imminent Monitor RAT ; however , at the beginning of 2018 , we also observed the use of LuminosityLink RAT , NetWire RAT , and NjRAT . In a case in June 2019 , we also noticed Warzone RAT being used . Xpert RAT reportedly first appeared in 2011 . The first version of Proyecto RAT” was published at the end of 2010 . But with the West African gang we’ve named Scattered Canary , we have a deeper look at how business email compromise is connected to the rest of the cybercrime .",1,"The Emissary Panda threat group loaded the China Chopper webshell onto SharePoint servers at two Government organizations in the Middle East , which we believe with high confidence involved exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in SharePoint tracked in [CVE] .

These malware families have a rich history of being used in many targeted attacks against government and private organizations . The activity surfaced in Southeast Asia , a region where APT10 frequently operates . The samples we analyzed originated from the Philippines . APT10 frequently targets the Southeast Asia region . Both of the loader’s variants and their various payloads that enSilo analyzed share similar Tactics , Techniques , and Procedures and code associated with APT10 . Typically , APT10 tends to employ a namesquatting scheme in their domains that aims to confuse the observer by posing as a legitimate domain . Also , the certificate embedded in the Quasar sample was issued at 22.12.2018 , which correlates with the file’s compilation date . Over the past three months , Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has observed an increase in APT33’s also known as Elfin infrastructure building and targeting activity , and on June 21 , 2019 , Yahoo . News reported that the U.S. Cyber Command launched cyberattacks on an Iranian spy group . Iranian state-sponsored threat actor APT33 has been conducting cyberespionage activity since at least 2013 , predominantly targeting nations in the Middle East , but also notably targeting U.S. , South Korean , and European commercial entities across a wide variety of sectors . Our research found that APT33 , or a closely aligned threat actor , continues to conduct and prepare for widespread cyberespionage activity , with over 1 , 200 domains used since March 28 , 2019 and with a strong emphasis on using commodity malware . The targeting of mainly Saudi Arabian organizations across a wide variety of industries aligns with historical targeting patterns for the group , which appear undeterred following previous exposés of their activity . Towards the end of April 2019 , we tracked down what we believe to be new activity by APT10 , a Chinese Cyber Espionage group . Almost 60% of the suspected APT33 domains that were classified to malware families related to njRAT infections , a RAT not previously associated with APT33 activity . Other commodity RAT malware families , such as AdwindRAT and RevengeRAT , were also linked to suspected APT33 domain activity . APT33 is an Iranian state-sponsored threat actor that has engaged in cyberespionage activities since at least 2013 . Western and Saudi organizations in industries that have been historically targeted by APT33 should be monitoring geopolitical developments and increasing the scrutiny of operational security controls focusing on detection and remediation of initial unauthorized access , specifically from phishing campaigns , webshells . Symantec’s Elfin report denoted additional targeting of the engineering , chemical , research , finance , IT , and healthcare sectors . We assess that the recent reporting on links between the Nasr Institute and Kavosh Security Group , as well as technical and persona analysis , overlaps among APT33 , APT35 , and MUDDYWATER , and is probably a result of the tiered structure that Iran utilizes to manage cyber operations . Recorded Future has been monitoring APT33 activity , beginning with research published in October 2017 , which revealed new infrastructure , malware hashes , and TTPs relating to the threat actor(s) . FireEye also noted in their 2017 report that the online handle xman_1365_x , ” found within the PDB path in an APT33 TURNEDUP backdoor sample , belonged to an individual at the Nasr Institute . Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has been monitoring APT33 activity , beginning with research published in October 2017 , which revealed new infrastructure , malware hashes , and TTPs relating to the threat actor(s) . Based on this information , it is possible that upon the exposure of the Nasr Institute as a front for Iranian state-sponsored offensive cyber activity , employees transitioned over to other entities , such as Kavosh , to protect their identities and minimize further exposure . Insikt Group researchers used proprietary methods , including Recorded Future Domain Analysis and Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis , along with other common analytical approaches , to profile recently reported Iranian threat actor APT33’s domain and hosting infrastructure in an effort to identify recent activity . Insikt Group enumerated all domains reported as being used by APT33 since January 2019 . PlugX is a modular structured malware that has many different operational plugins such as communication compression and encryption , network enumeration , files interaction , remote shell operations and more . Using data from Recorded Future Domain Analysis and combining it with data derived from Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis , Insikt Group researchers were able to identify a small selection of likely targeted organizations impacted by suspected APT33 activity . Following the exposure of a wide range of their infrastructure and operations by Symantec earlier this year , we discovered that APT33 , or closely aligned actors , reacted by either parking or reassigning some of their domain infrastructure . Since late March , suspected APT33 threat actors have continued to use a large swath of operational infrastructure , well in excess of 1 , 200 domains , with many observed communicating with 19 different commodity RAT implants . While we haven’t observed a widespread targeting of commercial entities or regional adversaries like in previously documented APT33 operations , the handful of targeted organizations that we did observe were mainly located in Saudi Arabia across a range of industries , indicating ongoing targeting aligned with geopolitical aims . The zip contained a sample of the Poison Ivy malware which is also known to be used by APT10 . The new malware families , which we will examine later in this post , show APT34 relying on their PowerShell development capabilities , as well as trying their hand at Golang . Additionally , with the assistance of our FireEye Labs Advanced Reverse Engineering (FLARE) , Intelligence , and Advanced Practices teams , we identified three new malware families and a reappearance of PICKPOCKET , malware exclusively observed in use by APT34 . This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries operating in the Middle East; however , we believe APT34's strongest interest is gaining access to financial , energy , and government entities . Additionally , with the assistance of FireEye Labs , we identified three new malware families and a reappearance of PICKPOCKET , malware exclusively observed in use by APT34 . APT34 is an Iran-nexus cluster of cyber espionage activity that has been active since at least 2014 . This CPE was created to ensure our customers are updated with new discoveries , activity and detection efforts related to this campaign , along with other recent activity from Iranian-nexus threat actors to include APT33 , which is mentioned in this updated FireEye blog post . On June 19 , 2019 , FireEye’s Managed Defense Security Operations Center received an exploit detection alert on one of our FireEye Endpoint Security appliances . A backdoor that communicates with a single command and control server using HTTP GET and POST requests , TONEDEAF supports collecting system information , uploading and downloading of files , and arbitrary shell command execution . FireEye’s Advanced Practices and Intelligence teams were able to identify additional artifacts and activity from the APT34 actors at other victim organizations . Of note , FireEye discovered two additional new malware families hosted at this domain , VALUEVAULT and LONGWATCH . This tool was previously observed during a Mandiant incident response in 2018 and , to date , solely utilized by APT34 . PICKPOCKET is a credential theft tool that dumps the user's website login credentials from Chrome , Firefox , and Internet Explorer to a file . FireEye detects this activity across our platforms , including named detection for TONEDEAF , VALUEVAULT , and LONGWATCH . Several spear-phishing campaigns attributed to Carbanak , all occurring between March and May 2018 , were analyzed by security researchers in 2018 . One of the most prolific APT-style cyberattacks , specifically targeting the financial sector , is known as Carbanak . Discovered in 2014 , the campaign quickly gained notoriety after compromising the security systems of 100 banks in 40 countries and stealing up to $1 billion in the process . The same group is believed to have also been using the Cobalt Strike framework to run sophisticated campaigns , plotting and performing financial heists of financial institutions . Banks in countries such as Russia , the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , Spain , Romania , Belarus , Poland , Estonia , Bulgaria , Georgia , Moldova , Kyrgyzstan , Armenia , Taiwan and Malaysia have allegedly been targeted with spearphishing emails , luring victims into clicking malicious URLs and executing booby-trapped documents . A Carbanak trademark in cyberattacks remains the use of Cobalt Strike – a powerful pentesting tool designed for exploiting and executing malicious code , simulating post-exploitation actions of advanced threat actors – which allows them to infiltrate the organization , move laterally , exfiltrate data , and deploy anti-forensic and evasion tools . However , this action doesn’t appear to have made a dent in the cybercriminal organization , as subsequent spear-phishing campaigns seem to have been reported from March until May 2018 . Bitdefender’s forensics and investigation team was contacted to look into a security incident that started in May 2018 with an email received by two of the bank’s employees . The Carbanak group , which has a long track record of compromising infrastructure belonging to financial institutions , is still active . Its purpose remains to manipulate financial assets , such as transferring funds from bank accounts or taking over ATM infrastructures and instructing them to dispense cash at predetermined time intervals . If the attack had succeeded , it would have given hackers control over the ATM network , while money mules would have been standing by the ATM machines at pre-set time intervals to cash them out . The actors uploaded a variety of tools that they used to perform additional activities on the compromised network , such as dumping credentials , as well as locating and pivoting to additional systems on the network . We believe Emissary Panda exploited a recently patched vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint tracked by CVE-2019-0604 , which is a remote code execution vulnerability used to compromise the server and eventually install a webshell . Bitdefender’s investigation shows the attackers’ main methods remain to quietly infiltrate the infrastructure by establishing a foothold on an employee’s system , then move laterally across the infrastructure or elevate privileges to find critical systems that manage financial transactions or ATM networks . We also found the China Chopper webshell on the SharePoint servers , which has also been used by the Emissary Panda threat group . Of particular note is their use of tools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144 , which is the same vulnerability exploited by EternalBlue that is best known for its use in the WannaCry attacks of 2017 . In addition to the aforementioned post-exploitation tools , the actors used these webshells to upload legitimate executables that they would use DLL sideloading to run a malicious DLL that has code overlaps with known Emissary Panda attacks . This webshell activity took place across three SharePoint servers hosted by two different government organizations between April 1 , 2019 and April 16 , 2019 , where actors uploaded a total of 24 unique executables across the three SharePoint servers . The timeline shows three main clusters of activity across the three webshells , with activity occurring on two separate webshells within a very small window of time on April 2 , 2019 and the activity involving the third webshell two weeks later on April 16 , 2019 . In April 2019 , several national security organizations released alerts on CVE-2019-0604 exploitation , including the Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center and the Canadian Center for Cyber Security . Based on the functionality of the various tools uploaded to the webshells , we believe the threat actors breach the SharePoint servers to use as a beachhead , then attempt to move laterally across the network via stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities . We also observed the actors uploading custom backdoors such as HyperBro which is commonly associated with Emissary Panda . Both of these alerts discussed campaigns in which actors used the CVE-2019-0604 to exploit SharePoint servers to install the China Chopper webshell . During our research into this attack campaign , Unit 42 gathered several tools that the Emissary Panda uploaded to the three webshells at the two government organizations . We also observed the actors uploading the HyperBro backdoor to one of the webshells , as well as legitimate executables that would sideload malicious DLLs that have overlapping code associated with known Emissary Panda activity . Lastly , we saw the actor uploading a custom backdoor called HyperBro , which has been associated with Emissary Panda operations in the past . The other overlapping files are tools used by the adversary to locate other systems on the network ( etool.exe ) , check to see if they are vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144 ( EternalBlue ) patched in MS07-010 (checker1.exe) and pivot to them using remote execution functionality offered by a tool similar to PsExec offered by Impacket ( psexec.exe ) . Also , the NCSC advisory mentioned that the actors used a file name stylecss.aspx for their webshell , which is the same filename we saw associated with China Chopper . we will provide an analysis of the HyperBro tool in an upcoming section . However , using NCC Group’s research published in May 2018 , we were able to discover code overlaps between these DLLs and a sideloaded DLL that ran the SysUpdate tool that the NCC group has associated with an Emissary Panda campaign . The list also includes several hack tools , such as Mimikatz for credential dumping and several compiled python scripts used to locate and compromise other systems on the local network . Unfortunately , we do not have access to the PYTHON33.hlp or CreateTsMediaAdm.hlp files , so we do not know the final payload loaded by either of these DLLs . Figure 9 shows a code comparison between the PYTHON33.dll (right) and inicore_v2.3.30.dll (left) (SHA256: 4d65d371a789aabe1beadcc10b38da1f998cd3ec87d4cc1cfbf0af014b783822 ) , which was sideloaded to run the SysUpdate tool in a previous Emissary Panda campaign .",1,"Group-IB specialists determined that the email addresses of IT bank employees were among the recipients of these emails .

Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has been monitoring APT33 activity , beginning with research published in October 2017 , which revealed new infrastructure , malware hashes , and TTPs relating to the threat actor(s) . Based on this information , it is possible that upon the exposure of the Nasr Institute as a front for Iranian state-sponsored offensive cyber activity , employees transitioned over to other entities , such as Kavosh , to protect their identities and minimize further exposure . Insikt Group researchers used proprietary methods , including Recorded Future Domain Analysis and Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis , along with other common analytical approaches , to profile recently reported Iranian threat actor APT33’s domain and hosting infrastructure in an effort to identify recent activity . Insikt Group enumerated all domains reported as being used by APT33 since January 2019 . PlugX is a modular structured malware that has many different operational plugins such as communication compression and encryption , network enumeration , files interaction , remote shell operations and more . Using data from Recorded Future Domain Analysis and combining it with data derived from Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis , Insikt Group researchers were able to identify a small selection of likely targeted organizations impacted by suspected APT33 activity . Following the exposure of a wide range of their infrastructure and operations by Symantec earlier this year , we discovered that APT33 , or closely aligned actors , reacted by either parking or reassigning some of their domain infrastructure . Since late March , suspected APT33 threat actors have continued to use a large swath of operational infrastructure , well in excess of 1 , 200 domains , with many observed communicating with 19 different commodity RAT implants . While we haven’t observed a widespread targeting of commercial entities or regional adversaries like in previously documented APT33 operations , the handful of targeted organizations that we did observe were mainly located in Saudi Arabia across a range of industries , indicating ongoing targeting aligned with geopolitical aims . The zip contained a sample of the Poison Ivy malware which is also known to be used by APT10 . The new malware families , which we will examine later in this post , show APT34 relying on their PowerShell development capabilities , as well as trying their hand at Golang . Additionally , with the assistance of our FireEye Labs Advanced Reverse Engineering (FLARE) , Intelligence , and Advanced Practices teams , we identified three new malware families and a reappearance of PICKPOCKET , malware exclusively observed in use by APT34 . This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries operating in the Middle East; however , we believe APT34's strongest interest is gaining access to financial , energy , and government entities . Additionally , with the assistance of FireEye Labs , we identified three new malware families and a reappearance of PICKPOCKET , malware exclusively observed in use by APT34 . APT34 is an Iran-nexus cluster of cyber espionage activity that has been active since at least 2014 . This CPE was created to ensure our customers are updated with new discoveries , activity and detection efforts related to this campaign , along with other recent activity from Iranian-nexus threat actors to include APT33 , which is mentioned in this updated FireEye blog post . On June 19 , 2019 , FireEye’s Managed Defense Security Operations Center received an exploit detection alert on one of our FireEye Endpoint Security appliances . A backdoor that communicates with a single command and control server using HTTP GET and POST requests , TONEDEAF supports collecting system information , uploading and downloading of files , and arbitrary shell command execution . FireEye’s Advanced Practices and Intelligence teams were able to identify additional artifacts and activity from the APT34 actors at other victim organizations . Of note , FireEye discovered two additional new malware families hosted at this domain , VALUEVAULT and LONGWATCH . This tool was previously observed during a Mandiant incident response in 2018 and , to date , solely utilized by APT34 . PICKPOCKET is a credential theft tool that dumps the user's website login credentials from Chrome , Firefox , and Internet Explorer to a file . FireEye detects this activity across our platforms , including named detection for TONEDEAF , VALUEVAULT , and LONGWATCH . Several spear-phishing campaigns attributed to Carbanak , all occurring between March and May 2018 , were analyzed by security researchers in 2018 . One of the most prolific APT-style cyberattacks , specifically targeting the financial sector , is known as Carbanak . Discovered in 2014 , the campaign quickly gained notoriety after compromising the security systems of 100 banks in 40 countries and stealing up to $1 billion in the process . The same group is believed to have also been using the Cobalt Strike framework to run sophisticated campaigns , plotting and performing financial heists of financial institutions . Banks in countries such as Russia , the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , Spain , Romania , Belarus , Poland , Estonia , Bulgaria , Georgia , Moldova , Kyrgyzstan , Armenia , Taiwan and Malaysia have allegedly been targeted with spearphishing emails , luring victims into clicking malicious URLs and executing booby-trapped documents . A Carbanak trademark in cyberattacks remains the use of Cobalt Strike – a powerful pentesting tool designed for exploiting and executing malicious code , simulating post-exploitation actions of advanced threat actors – which allows them to infiltrate the organization , move laterally , exfiltrate data , and deploy anti-forensic and evasion tools . However , this action doesn’t appear to have made a dent in the cybercriminal organization , as subsequent spear-phishing campaigns seem to have been reported from March until May 2018 . Bitdefender’s forensics and investigation team was contacted to look into a security incident that started in May 2018 with an email received by two of the bank’s employees . The Carbanak group , which has a long track record of compromising infrastructure belonging to financial institutions , is still active . Its purpose remains to manipulate financial assets , such as transferring funds from bank accounts or taking over ATM infrastructures and instructing them to dispense cash at predetermined time intervals . If the attack had succeeded , it would have given hackers control over the ATM network , while money mules would have been standing by the ATM machines at pre-set time intervals to cash them out . The actors uploaded a variety of tools that they used to perform additional activities on the compromised network , such as dumping credentials , as well as locating and pivoting to additional systems on the network . We believe Emissary Panda exploited a recently patched vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint tracked by [CVE] , which is a remote code execution vulnerability used to compromise the server and eventually install a webshell . Bitdefender’s investigation shows the attackers’ main methods remain to quietly infiltrate the infrastructure by establishing a foothold on an employee’s system , then move laterally across the infrastructure or elevate privileges to find critical systems that manage financial transactions or ATM networks . We also found the China Chopper webshell on the SharePoint servers , which has also been used by the Emissary Panda threat group . Of particular note is their use of tools to identify systems vulnerable to [CVE] , which is the same vulnerability exploited by EternalBlue that is best known for its use in the WannaCry attacks of 2017 . In addition to the aforementioned post-exploitation tools , the actors used these webshells to upload legitimate executables that they would use DLL sideloading to run a malicious DLL that has code overlaps with known Emissary Panda attacks . This webshell activity took place across three SharePoint servers hosted by two different government organizations between April 1 , 2019 and April 16 , 2019 , where actors uploaded a total of 24 unique executables across the three SharePoint servers . The timeline shows three main clusters of activity across the three webshells , with activity occurring on two separate webshells within a very small window of time on April 2 , 2019 and the activity involving the third webshell two weeks later on April 16 , 2019 . In April 2019 , several national security organizations released alerts on [CVE] exploitation , including the Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center and the Canadian Center for Cyber Security . Based on the functionality of the various tools uploaded to the webshells , we believe the threat actors breach the SharePoint servers to use as a beachhead , then attempt to move laterally across the network via stolen credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities . We also observed the actors uploading custom backdoors such as HyperBro which is commonly associated with Emissary Panda . Both of these alerts discussed campaigns in which actors used the [CVE] to exploit SharePoint servers to install the China Chopper webshell . During our research into this attack campaign , Unit 42 gathered several tools that the Emissary Panda uploaded to the three webshells at the two government organizations . We also observed the actors uploading the HyperBro backdoor to one of the webshells , as well as legitimate executables that would sideload malicious DLLs that have overlapping code associated with known Emissary Panda activity . Lastly , we saw the actor uploading a custom backdoor called HyperBro , which has been associated with Emissary Panda operations in the past . The other overlapping files are tools used by the adversary to locate other systems on the network ( etool.exe ) , check to see if they are vulnerable to [CVE] ( EternalBlue ) patched in MS07-010 (checker1.exe) and pivot to them using remote execution functionality offered by a tool similar to PsExec offered by Impacket ( psexec.exe ) . Also , the NCSC advisory mentioned that the actors used a file name stylecss.aspx for their webshell , which is the same filename we saw associated with China Chopper . we will provide an analysis of the HyperBro tool in an upcoming section . However , using NCC Group’s research published in May 2018 , we were able to discover code overlaps between these DLLs and a sideloaded DLL that ran the SysUpdate tool that the NCC group has associated with an Emissary Panda campaign . The list also includes several hack tools , such as Mimikatz for credential dumping and several compiled python scripts used to locate and compromise other systems on the local network . Unfortunately , we do not have access to the PYTHON33.hlp or CreateTsMediaAdm.hlp files , so we do not know the final payload loaded by either of these DLLs . Figure 9 shows a code comparison between the PYTHON33.dll (right) and inicore_v2.3.30.dll (left) (SHA256: 4d65d371a789aabe1beadcc10b38da1f998cd3ec87d4cc1cfbf0af014b783822 ) , which was sideloaded to run the SysUpdate tool in a previous Emissary Panda campaign ."

"The dropper first appeared in mid-July , suggesting that this APT activity is potentially ongoing , with Turla actively targeting G20 participants and/or those with interest in the G20 , including member nations , journalists , and policymakers . Turla is a well-documented , long operating APT group that is widely believed to be a Russian state-sponsored organization . Turla is perhaps most notoriously suspected as responsible for the breach of the United States Central Command in 2008 . More recently Turla was accused of breaching RUAG , a Swiss technology company , in a public report published by GovCERT.ch . The delivery of KopiLuwak in this instance is currently unknown as the MSIL dropper has only been observed by Proofpoint researchers on a public malware repository . Assuming this variant of KopiLuwak has been observed in the wild , there are a number of ACTs it may have been delivered including some of Turla’s previous attack methods such as spear phishing or via a watering hole . This could include diplomats , experts in the LOCs of interest related to the Digital Economy Task Force , or possibly even journalists . Turla's goal could include diplomats , experts in the LOCs of interest related to the Digital Economy Task Force , or possibly even journalists . The earliest step in any possible attack(s) involving this variant of KopiLuwak of which Proofpoint researchers are currently aware begin with the MSIL dropper . The basic chain of events upon execution of the MSIL dropper include dropping and executing both a PDF decoy and a Javascript (JS) dropper . As explained in further detail below , the JS dropper ultimately installs a JS decryptor onto an infected machine that will then finally decrypt and execute the actual KopiLuwak backdoor in memory only . As Proofpoint has not yet observed this attack in the wild it is likely that there is an additional component that leads to the execution of the MSIL payload . The newer variant of KopiLuwak is now capable of exfiltrating files to the C&C as well as downloading files and saving them to the infected machine . Despite the added capabilities , we still agree with Kaspersky that this backdoor is likely used as an initial reconnaissance tool and would probably be used as a staging point to deploy one of Turla’s more fully featured implants . Turla is a complex cyberattack platform focused predominantly on diplomatic and government-related targets , particularly in the Middle East , Central and Far East Asia , Europe , North and South America and former Soviet bloc nations . We didn’t choose to name it after a vegetable; the .NET malware developers named it Topinambour themselves . The role of the .NET module is to deliver the known KopiLuwak JavaScript Trojan .

"In total , Scattered Canary received more than 3 , 000 account credentials as a result of their phishing attacks . For over eighteen months from March 2017 until November 2018 , Scattered Canary’s frequent enterprise-focused credential phishing campaigns almost exclusively targeted businesses in the United States and Canada . In July 2018 , following a trend we have observed across the entire BEC threat landscape , Scattered Canary changed their preferred cash out mechanism from wire transfers to gift cards . Instead of using fake Google Docs phishing pages to collect personal email login credentials , Scattered Canary began using phishing pages of commonly used business applications to compromise enterprise credentials . Using personal information obtained from various sources , Scattered Canary started perpetrating fraud against US federal and state government agencies . In total , 35 actors have been tied to Scattered Canary’s operations since the group emerged in 2008 . Just as with romance scams , actors make use of scripts and templates they can copy-and-paste without having to create something on their own . When it comes to engaging targets , Scattered Canary frequently maximized efficiencies through the use of scripts , or as some members of the group call them , formats.” These formats are templated text documents that can contain several layers of phishing messages to send to potential victims . Recently , we unveiled the existence of a UEFI rootkit , called LoJax , which we attribute to the Sednit group . If Scattered Canary can be seen as a microcosm for the rapidly evolving organizations behind today’s most pernicious email scams , this report demonstrates that a much more holistic approach—one based on threat actor identity rather than type of fraudulent activity—is required to detect email fraud and protect organizations . This is a first for an APT group , and shows Sednit has access to very sophisticated tools to conduct its espionage operations . Three years ago , the Sednit group unleashed new components targeting victims in various countries in the Middle East and Central Asia . In the past , Sednit used a similar technique for credential phishing . At the end of August 2018 , the Sednit group launched a spearphishing email campaign where it distributed shortened URLs that delivered the first stage of Zebrocy components . As we explained in our most recent blogpost about Zebrocy , the configuration of the backdoor is stored in in the resource section and is split into four different hex-encoded , encrypted blobs . The past iteration of SLUB spread from a unique watering hole website exploiting CVE-2018-8174 , a VBScript engine vulnerability . It used GitHub and Slack as tools for communication between the malware and its controller . On July 9 , we discovered a new version of SLUB delivered via another unique watering hole website .

"Early in Q2 , Kaspersky identified an interesting Lazarus attack targeting a mobile gaming company in South Korea that we believe was aimed at stealing application source code . In a recent campaign , Kaspersky observed ScarCruft using a multi-stage binary to infect several victims and ultimately install a final payload known as ROKRAT – a cloud service-based backdoor . ESET recently analyzed a new Mac OS sample from the OceanLotus group that had been uploaded to VirusTotal . The threat actor behind the campaign , which Kaspersky believes to be the PLATINUM APT group , uses an elaborate , previously unseen , steganographic technique to conceal communication . FireEye defined APT40 as the Chinese state-sponsored threat actor previously reported as TEMP.Periscope , Leviathan and TEMP.Jumper . In January , Kaspersky identified new activity by the Transparent Tribe APT group aka PROJECTM and MYTHIC LEOPARD , a threat actor with interests aligned with Pakistan that has shown a persistent focus on Indian military targets . OceanLotus was another actor active during this period , using a new downloader called KerrDown , as reported by Palo Alto . ESET recently uncovered a new addition to OceanLotus’s toolset targeting Mac OS . In mid-2018 , Kaspersky's report on Operation AppleJeus” highlighted the focus of the Lazarus threat actor on cryptocurrency exchanges . Kaspersky also observed some activity from Gaza Team and MuddyWater . Kaspersky wrote about LuckyMouse targeting national data centers in June . Kaspersky also discovered that LuckyMouse unleashed a new wave of activity targeting Asian governmental organizations just around the time they had gathered for a summit in China . Kaspersky have observed similar activity in the past from groups such as Oilrig and Stonedrill , which leads us to believe the new attacks could be connected , though for now that connection is only assessed as low confidence . In August 2019 , FireEye released the Double Dragon” report on our newest graduated threat group , APT41 . Today , FireEye Intelligence is releasing a comprehensive report detailing APT41 , a prolific Chinese cyber threat group that carries out state-sponsored espionage activity in parallel with financially motivated operations . Group-IB experts continuously monitor the Silence’ activities . Group-IB has uncovered a hacker group , MoneyTaker , attacking banks in the USA and Russia . Group-IB reveals the unknown details of attacks from one of the most notorious APT groups , Lazarus . Finally , Kaspersky produced a summary report on Sofacy’s summertime activity .

"The installed EXE file is almost exactly the same as the DLL version of Bisonal variant used against the Russian organization . The targets are military or defense industry in particular countries , it used DDNS for C2 servers , and tracked connections from their victims by using target or campaign codes , as well as disguising the malware as document file , and using a dropper to install the malware and decoy file . A previous campaign of this APT group was uncovered by Talos in June 2017 , and since then very little of this operation was seen in the wild . ined in the archive is called DriverInstallerU.exe” but its metadata shows that its original name is Interenet Assistant.exe” . After reviewing all the malware functionalities , we are confident in saying that the attackers look for victims who answer well-defined characteristics and believe that further stages of the attack are delivered only to those who fit the specific victim profile . In this sample , however , the module names were changed from actors and characters’ names to car models , namely BMW_x1” , BMW_x2” and up to BMW_x8” . But , thanks to the attackers known affection for decoy documents that pose as news summaries , we were able to date the campaign back to March 2018 . With the experience gained from the APT attack that began in March 2017 , it seems this campaign has evolved into an attack with new capabilities , and an even more specific target , over a year later . These unknown actors continued launching DDoS attacks over the next few years . For simplicity , Kaspersky is calling them the BlackEnergy APT group . Since the middle of 2015 , one of the preferred attack vectors for BlackEnergy in Ukraine has been Excel documents with macros that drop the Trojan to disk if the user chooses to run the script in the document . A very good analysis and overview of the BlackEnergy attacks in Ukraine throughout 2014 and 2015 was published by the Ukrainian security firm Cys Centrum the text is only available in Russian for now , but can be read via Google Translate . The earliest signs of destructive payloads with BlackEnergy go back as far as June 2014 . BlackEnergy is a highly dynamic threat actor and the current attacks in Ukraine indicate that destructive actions are on their main agenda , in addition to compromising industrial control installations and espionage activities . Kaspersky will continue to monitor the BlackEnergy attacks in Ukraine and update our readers with more data when available . From Buhtrap perpetrating cybercrime for financial gain , its toolset has been expanded with malware used to conduct espionage in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . Throughout our tracking , we've seen this group deploy its main backdoor as well as other tools against various victims , but June 2019 was the first time we saw the Buhtrap group use a zero-day exploit as part of a campaign . In that case , we observed Buhtrap using a local privilege escalation exploit , CVE-2019-1132 , against one of its victims . However , as the shift in targets occurred before the source code leak , we assess with high confidence that the same people behind the first Buhtrap malware attacks against businesses and banks are also involved in targeting governmental institutions . When Buhtrap was targeting businesses , the decoy documents would typically be contracts or invoices . The Buhtrap group is well known for its targeting of financial institutions and businesses in Russia . Figure 2 is a typical example of a generic invoice the group used in a campaign in 2014 . When the group's focus shifted to banks , the decoy documents were related to banking system regulations or advisories from FinCERT , an organization created by the Russian government to provide help and guidance to its financial institutions . We confirmed that this is a DarkHydrus Group's new attack targeting Middle East region . In July 2018 , Palo Alto disclosed DarkHydrus Group which showed its special interest to governments in Middle East . Prior to that report , we published detail analysis on malware exploiting CVE-2018-8414 vulnerability (remote code execution in SettingContent-ms) , which is believed a work of DarkHydrus . However , the final payload is something that welivesecurity have never seen associated with Buhtrap . It's coincident that both 'darkhydrus' APT group name and ‘Williams’ user name in PDB path found in this Twitter user . In recent APT incidents , Dark Hydruns tend to adopt Office VBA macro instead of Office 0day vulnerability in the consideration of cost reduction . ASERT uncovered a credential theft campaign we call LUCKY ELEPHANT where attackers masquerade as legitimate entities such as foreign government , telecommunications , and military . From at least February 2019 to present , the actors in the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign copied webpages to mimic South Asian government websites as well as Microsoft Outlook 365 login pages and hosted them on their own doppelganger domains , presumably to trick victims into providing login credentials . ASERT suspects that the Actors use phishing emails to lure victims to the doppelganger websites and entice users to enter their credentials . It is important to note that one domain , yahoomail[.]cf is only associated with this group from February 2019 onward . In late 2018 , the domain was associated with a different APT group / campaign of Chinese origin . Based on our analysis into the activity , ASERT deems with moderate confidence that an Indian APT group is behind the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign . The targets are typical of known Indian APT activity and the infrastructure was previously used by an Indian APT group . DoNot Team has a history of heavily targeting Pakistan , in addition to other neighboring countries . The 360 Intelligence Center observed four distinct campaigns against Pakistan since 2017 (link) , recently targeting Pakistani businessmen working in China .

"This question of perception and accuracy rests upon the underlying epistemic framework and the goal conceived for that framework in defining an adversary : FireEye ’s methodology follows a deductive approach requiring the collection of significant evidence over time to yield a conclusion that will be necessary given the premises ( the totality of evidence suggests APTxx ) ; the Dragos approach instead seeks an inductive approach , where premises may all be true but the conclusion need not necessarily follow from them given changes in premises over time or other observations not contained within the set ( thus , identified behaviors strongly suggests an activity group , defined as X ) .",1,"This question of perception and accuracy rests upon the underlying epistemic framework and the goal conceived for that framework in defining an adversary : FireEye ’s methodology follows a deductive approach requiring the collection of significant evidence over time to yield a conclusion that will be necessary given the premises ( the totality of evidence suggests APTxx ) ; the Dragos approach instead seeks an inductive approach , where premises may all be true but the conclusion need not necessarily follow from them given changes in premises over time or other observations not contained within the set ( thus , identified behaviors strongly suggests an activity group , defined as X ) ."

"From the time of file creation , the attacker started working at least as early as July 2018 . The link to feeds.rapidfeeds.com left in its XML configuration file was also mentioned by Kaspersky’s report in the reference section , which confirms that the APT-C-09 group keeps updating its C2 configuration channel and the recent one reserves some past features . For example , Donot and Bitter disguised as Kashmiri Voice to attack Pakistan , Transparent Tribe attacked India with decoy document regarding terrorist attacks in Kashmir . Considering APT-C-09 , Bitter and Donot have carried out targeted attacks against China , we must take actions in advance and keep a close eye on their recent activities . APT41 espionage operations against the healthcare , high-tech , and telecommunications sectors include establishing and maintaining strategic access , and through mid-2015 , the theft of intellectual property . FireEye Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that APT41 carries out an array of financially motivated intrusions , particularly against the video game industry , including stealing source code and digital certificates , virtual currency manipulation , and attempting to deploy ransomware . APT41 has executed multiple software supply chain compromises , gaining access to software companies to inject malicious code into legitimate files before distributing updates . APT41 is unique among tracked China-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware typically reserved for espionage operations in what appears to be activity that falls outside the scope of state-sponsored missions . Based on early observed activity , consistent behavior , and APT41's unusual focus on the video game industry , we believe the group's cyber crime activities are most likely motivated by personal financial gain or hobbyist interests . APT41 campaigns include most of the incidents previously attributed in FireEye Threat Intelligence reporting to GREF Team and a number of additional clusters that were previously unnamed . Activity traces back to 2012 when individual members of APT41 conducted primarily financially motivated operations focused on the video game industry before expanding into likely statesponsored activity . Learning to access video game production environments enabled APT41 to develop the tactics , techniques , and procedures (TTPs) that were later leveraged against software companies to inject malicious code into software updates . APT41 has targeted organizations in 14 countries over seven years , including: France , India , Italy , Japan , Myanmar , the Netherlands , Singapore , South Korea , South Africa , Switzerland , Thailand , Turkey , the United Kingdom , and the United States (Figure 1) . APT41 espionage operations against entities in these countries follow targeting of verticals consistent with Chinese national policy priorities . We believe that like other Chinese espionage operators , APT41 has moved toward strategic intelligence collection and establishing access , but aACT from direct intellectual property theft . In 2014 , APT41 was observed carrying out espionage campaigns concurrently with financially motivated intrusions , demonstrating that they could balance different objectives simultaneously . Since 2017 , APT41's activities have included a series of supply chain compromises . The group also targeted companies involved in producing motherboards , processors , and server solutions for enterprises . Since 2013 , APT41 has targeted organizations involved in the research , development , and sale of computer components used for machine-learning , autonomous vehicles , medical imaging , and the consumer market . In a 2014 compromise , APT41 targeted a European conglomerate and specifically focused on systems physically located in China . In spring 2015 , APT41 targeted information related to two entities undergoing a merger announced the previous year . Since 2017 , APT41 has consistently targeted telecommunications companies , possibly a crucial first step to establish a foothold in targeting a particular region . Targeted telecom companies spanned several countries , and recently identified intrusions were concentrated in countries where we had not identified any prior APT41 activity . In July and August 2016 , APT41 sent spear-phishing emails to Hong Kong media organizations known for pro-democracy editorial content . This was the first instance we have observed of APT41 targeting pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong . APT41 frequently leverages timely news stories as the lure content in their spear-phishing emails , although social engineering content does not alACTs correlate with targeted users or organizations . In 2015 , APT41 targeted a Japanese media organization with a lure document (Figure 3) titled 中東呼吸器症候 群(MERS)の予防 , ” which translates to Prevention of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) . APT41 activity aimed at medical device companies and pharmaceuticals is demonstrative of the group's capacity to collect sensitive and highly valuable intellectual property (IP) , although we have not observed evidence of IP theft since late 2015 . Unlike other observed Chinese espionage operators , APT41 conducts explicit financially motivated activity , which has included the use of tools that are otherwise exclusively used in campaigns supporting state interests . Although APT41 initially targeted the parent company , 30 percent of the victimized hosts were related to a subsidiary specialized in manufacturing medical devices . In 2018 , we observed APT41 target a third healthcare company , although their goals during this compromise were unclear . In June 2018 , APT41 sent spear-phishing emails using an invitation lure to join a decentralized gaming platform linked to a cryptocurrency service (Figure 5) that had positioned itself as a medium of exchange for online games and gambling sites . This provides another connection between the targeting of the cryptocurrency organizations and video game targeting . In October 2018 , the group compiled an instance of XMRig , a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool , demonstrating a continued interest in cryptocurrency . APT41 campaigns focused on the video game sector have largely affected studios and distributors in East and Southeast Asia , although global companies based in the United States have also been targeted . APT41 continuously returns to targeting the video game sector and seems to have matured its campaigns through lessons learned in operations against the industry . We believe these operations include broadly malicious activity that can enable further operations , such as targeting game source code and compromising digital certificates , while other activities are explicitly financially motivated , such as abusing in-game currency mechanics . In October 2012 , APT41 used captured credentials to compromise a jump server and access a production environment where they deployed a Linux version of PHOTO . Since at least 2012 , APT41 has repeatedly gained access to game development environments within affected companies , including online multiplayer networks , as well as targeting of production database administrators . APT41 has been observed inserting malicious code into legitimate video game files to distribute malware . In 2018 , the group inserted CRACKSHOT malware into game files that were signed with legitimate codesigning certificates , most likely indicating access to the production environment , which facilitated a supply chain compromise . We have also observed APT41 limitedly deploy rootkits on Linux systems and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits , such as ROCKBOOT , on Windows systems to hide their malware and maintain persistence on victim systems . Selective deployment of ROCKBOOT suggests that APT41 reserves more advanced TTPs and malware only for high-value targets . APT41 has blatantly engaged in financially motivated activity targeting the video game industry , including manipulating virtual currencies . In a highly unusual case , APT41 attempted to extort a game company by deploying the Encryptor RaaS ransomware . APT41 is well-known for leveraging compromised digital certificates from video game studios to sign malware . We suggest that APT41 sought to target in-game currency but found they could not monetize the specific targeted game , so the group resorted to ransomware to attempt to salvage their efforts and profit from the compromise . APT41 has also used credentials compromised in previous operations . In 2014 , APT41 compromised an online billing/payment service using VPN access between a third-party service provider and the targeted payment service . Although we do not have first-hand evidence of APT41's compromise of TeamViewer , we have observed APT41 use compromised TeamViewer credentials as an entry point at multiple organizations . Public reports of supply chain compromises linked to APT41 date back to at least 2014 , and technical evidence associated with these incidents was used to determine a relationship , if any , with APT41 . As demonstrated in operations targeting the video game industry , APT41 leverages a variety of TTPs to access production environments where they can inject malicious code into legitimate files . In March 2017 , suspected Chinese espionage operators targeted CCleaner , a utility that assists in the removal of unwanted files from a computer . In July 2017 , APT41 injected malicious code into a software update package maintained by Netsarang and signed it with a legitimate Netsarang certificate in an operation referred to as ShadowPad by Kaspersky . Both APT41 and the actors in the CCleaner incident used TeamViewer during initial compromise . Supply chain compromises are most likely an extension of APT41's tactics used in gaining access to gaming development environments and to other gaming organizations via third-party service providers . Beginning in July 2018 , APT41 appeared to have directly targeted several East and Southeast Asia-based video game developers and distributors to inject legitimate executables with the CRACKSHOT backdoor . The lure used to target the cryptocurrency exchange (displayed in Figure 5 and translated in Figure 6) referenced an online gaming platform , tying the cryptocurrency targeting to APT41's focus on video game-related targeting . FireEye malware analysis identified source code overlaps between malware used by APT41 in May 2016 targeting of a U.S.-based game development studio and the malware observed in supply chain compromises in 2017 and 2018 . In May 2016 , APT41 deployed a POISONPLUG sample at a U.S.-based game development studio . Alternatively , it is also possible that APT41 injected malicious code into the package prior to compilation , circumventing the need to steal the code-signing certificate and compile it on their own . Either APT41 is operating outside of state control but still working with other Chinese APT malware actors , tools , and infrastructure on a parttime or contractual basis , or APT41 is a full-time . APT41 uses many of the same tools and compromised digital certificates that have been leveraged by other Chinese espionage operators . Initial reports about HIGHNOON and its variants reported publicly as Winnti dating back to at least 2013 indicated the tool was exclusive to a single group , contributing to significant conflation across multiple distinct espionage operations . APT41 has used several malware families that have also been used by other Chinese espionage operators , including variants of HIGHNOON , HOMEUNIX , PHOTO , SOGU , and ZXSHELL , among others . HIGHNOON , one of the main code families observed being used by APT41 , was also used by APT17 in 2015 to target semiconductor and chemical manufacturers . HOMEUNIX , another popular backdoor used by APT41 , has been used by at least 14 separate Chinese espionage groups , including APT1 , APT10 , APT17 , APT18 , and APT20 . APT41 has used CROSSWALK.BIN , a kernel driver , to circumvent firewalls and covertly send data . Another Chinese espionage group used a similar tool , CLASSFON , to covertly proxy network communications in 2011 . At least two of these malware families , HIGHNOON.CLI and GEARSHIFT , have been used by APT17 and another suspected Chinese espionage group . APT41 regularly leverages code-signing certificates to sign malware when targeting both gaming and nongaming organizations . In July 2017 , APT41 initiated a TeamViewer session and transferred files that were later deleted . In these instances , APT41 leveraged TeamViewer to transfer malware into the compromised environment , although we do not have direct evidence of APT41 compromising TeamViewer . In May 2018 , APT41 used TeamViewer for initial entry in the compromise of a healthcare company . Notably , APT41 was observed using proof-of-concept exploit code for CVE-2019-3396 within 23 days after the Confluence . APT41 has targeted payment services specializing in handling in-game transactions and real money transfer (RMT) purchases .",1,"From the time of file creation , the attacker started working at least as early as July 2018 . The link to [DOMAIN] left in its XML configuration file was also mentioned by Kaspersky’s report in the reference section , which confirms that the APT-C-09 group keeps updating its C2 configuration channel and the recent one reserves some past features . For example , Donot and Bitter disguised as Kashmiri Voice to attack Pakistan , Transparent Tribe attacked India with decoy document regarding terrorist attacks in Kashmir . Considering APT-C-09 , Bitter and Donot have carried out targeted attacks against China , we must take actions in advance and keep a close eye on their recent activities . APT41 espionage operations against the healthcare , high-tech , and telecommunications sectors include establishing and maintaining strategic access , and through mid-2015 , the theft of intellectual property . FireEye Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that APT41 carries out an array of financially motivated intrusions , particularly against the video game industry , including stealing source code and digital certificates , virtual currency manipulation , and attempting to deploy ransomware . APT41 has executed multiple software supply chain compromises , gaining access to software companies to inject malicious code into legitimate files before distributing updates . APT41 is unique among tracked China-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware typically reserved for espionage operations in what appears to be activity that falls outside the scope of state-sponsored missions . Based on early observed activity , consistent behavior , and APT41's unusual focus on the video game industry , we believe the group's cyber crime activities are most likely motivated by personal financial gain or hobbyist interests . APT41 campaigns include most of the incidents previously attributed in FireEye Threat Intelligence reporting to GREF Team and a number of additional clusters that were previously unnamed . Activity traces back to 2012 when individual members of APT41 conducted primarily financially motivated operations focused on the video game industry before expanding into likely statesponsored activity . Learning to access video game production environments enabled APT41 to develop the tactics , techniques , and procedures (TTPs) that were later leveraged against software companies to inject malicious code into software updates . APT41 has targeted organizations in 14 countries over seven years , including: France , India , Italy , Japan , Myanmar , the Netherlands , Singapore , South Korea , South Africa , Switzerland , Thailand , Turkey , the United Kingdom , and the United States (Figure 1) . APT41 espionage operations against entities in these countries follow targeting of verticals consistent with Chinese national policy priorities . We believe that like other Chinese espionage operators , APT41 has moved toward strategic intelligence collection and establishing access , but aACT from direct intellectual property theft . In 2014 , APT41 was observed carrying out espionage campaigns concurrently with financially motivated intrusions , demonstrating that they could balance different objectives simultaneously . Since 2017 , APT41's activities have included a series of supply chain compromises . The group also targeted companies involved in producing motherboards , processors , and server solutions for enterprises . Since 2013 , APT41 has targeted organizations involved in the research , development , and sale of computer components used for machine-learning , autonomous vehicles , medical imaging , and the consumer market . In a 2014 compromise , APT41 targeted a European conglomerate and specifically focused on systems physically located in China . In spring 2015 , APT41 targeted information related to two entities undergoing a merger announced the previous year . Since 2017 , APT41 has consistently targeted telecommunications companies , possibly a crucial first step to establish a foothold in targeting a particular region . Targeted telecom companies spanned several countries , and recently identified intrusions were concentrated in countries where we had not identified any prior APT41 activity . In July and August 2016 , APT41 sent spear-phishing emails to Hong Kong media organizations known for pro-democracy editorial content . This was the first instance we have observed of APT41 targeting pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong . APT41 frequently leverages timely news stories as the lure content in their spear-phishing emails , although social engineering content does not alACTs correlate with targeted users or organizations . In 2015 , APT41 targeted a Japanese media organization with a lure document (Figure 3) titled 中東呼吸器症候 群(MERS)の予防 , ” which translates to Prevention of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) . APT41 activity aimed at medical device companies and pharmaceuticals is demonstrative of the group's capacity to collect sensitive and highly valuable intellectual property (IP) , although we have not observed evidence of IP theft since late 2015 . Unlike other observed Chinese espionage operators , APT41 conducts explicit financially motivated activity , which has included the use of tools that are otherwise exclusively used in campaigns supporting state interests . Although APT41 initially targeted the parent company , 30 percent of the victimized hosts were related to a subsidiary specialized in manufacturing medical devices . In 2018 , we observed APT41 target a third healthcare company , although their goals during this compromise were unclear . In June 2018 , APT41 sent spear-phishing emails using an invitation lure to join a decentralized gaming platform linked to a cryptocurrency service (Figure 5) that had positioned itself as a medium of exchange for online games and gambling sites . This provides another connection between the targeting of the cryptocurrency organizations and video game targeting . In October 2018 , the group compiled an instance of XMRig , a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool , demonstrating a continued interest in cryptocurrency . APT41 campaigns focused on the video game sector have largely affected studios and distributors in East and Southeast Asia , although global companies based in the United States have also been targeted . APT41 continuously returns to targeting the video game sector and seems to have matured its campaigns through lessons learned in operations against the industry . We believe these operations include broadly malicious activity that can enable further operations , such as targeting game source code and compromising digital certificates , while other activities are explicitly financially motivated , such as abusing in-game currency mechanics . In October 2012 , APT41 used captured credentials to compromise a jump server and access a production environment where they deployed a Linux version of PHOTO . Since at least 2012 , APT41 has repeatedly gained access to game development environments within affected companies , including online multiplayer networks , as well as targeting of production database administrators . APT41 has been observed inserting malicious code into legitimate video game files to distribute malware . In 2018 , the group inserted CRACKSHOT malware into game files that were signed with legitimate codesigning certificates , most likely indicating access to the production environment , which facilitated a supply chain compromise . We have also observed APT41 limitedly deploy rootkits on Linux systems and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits , such as ROCKBOOT , on Windows systems to hide their malware and maintain persistence on victim systems . Selective deployment of ROCKBOOT suggests that APT41 reserves more advanced TTPs and malware only for high-value targets .

"Backdoors are installed in infected systems and SectorJ04 also distributed email stealers , botnet malware and ransomware through those backdoors . Backdoor installed in the infected system distributed additional botnet malware , ransomware and email stealers . SectorJ04 was recently confirmed to use additional backdoor called AdroMut and FlowerPippi , which is used to install other backdoor such as FlawedAmmy RAT on behalf of the MSI file , or to collect system information and send it to the attacker’s server . Although the SectorJ04 group mainly targeted countries located in Europe or North America , it has recently expanded its field of activities to countries located in Southeast Asia and East Asia . The email stealer collects connection protocol information and account information , such as SMTP , IMAP , and POP3 , which are stored in the registry by Outlook and Thunderbird mail clients and sends them to the attacker server in a specific format . A new type of backdoor called AdroMut and a new malware called FlowerPippi was also found coming from SectorJ04 . But after 2019 SectorJ04 has changed its hacking strategy to attack using spam email . The hacking activities of SectorJ04 group , which targeted South Korea in the first half of 2019 , have been continuously discovered . Prior to 2019 , the SectorJ04 group conducted large-scale hacking activities for financial gain using exploit kits on websites to install ransomware , such as Locky and GlobeImporter , along with its banking Trojan , on its victims computers . In June 2019 , continuous SectorJ04's activities targeting South Korea were found again and spam emails were written with various contents , including transaction statements , receipts and remittance cards . The SectorJ04 group has carried out large-scale hacking activities targeting South Korea , while also expanding the field of attacks to Southeast Asian countries such as Taiwan and the Philippines . In June , SectorJ04 group conducted hacking using spam emails written in various languages , including English , Arabic , Korean and Italian , and the emails were written with various contents , including remittance card , invoice and tax invoice . Spam emails and attachments written in Chinese were found in May , and the SectorJ04 group at that time targeted industrial sectors such as electronics and telecommunications , international schools and manufacturing . In addition to their preexist backdoor , ServHelper and FlawedAmmy , they have also been confirmed to use the backdoor called AdroMut and FlowerPippi . AdroMut downloads the malware ServHelper and FlawedAmmy RAT used by the SectorJ04 group from the attacker server and simultaneously performs the functions of a backdoor . The SectorJ04 group , which has been utilizing the same pattern of infection and the same malware for more than six months , is believed to be attempting to change its infection methods such as downloading malware directly from malicious documents without using MSI installation files , changing their spam email format and using new types of backdoor . Until 2019 , SectorJ04 group had carried out massive website-based hacking activities that mainly utilize ransomware and banking trojans for financial profit , and has also been carrying out information gathering activities to secure attack resources such as email accounts and system login information from users since 2019 . The SectorJ04 group has shown a pattern of hacking activities that have changed from targeted attacks to a large-scale distribution of spam . This allows them to expand their range of targets of hacking activities for financial profit , and in this regard , SectorJ04 group has been found to have hacked into a company’s internal network by using a spear phishing email targeting executives and employees of certain South Korean companies around February 2019 . SectorJ04 group carried out intensive hacking on various industrial sectors , including South Korea’s media , manufacturing and universities , around February and March 2019 . SectorJ04 used the spear phishing email to spread malicious Excel or malicious Word files , and downloaded the MSI files from the attacker’s server when the malicious documents were run . SectorJ04 group conducted hacking activities targeting financial institutions located in India and Hong Kong around April 2019 . SectorJ04 group carried out hacking activities targeting financial institutions located in Italy and other countries around May 2019 . In late July , SectorJ04 group used FlawedAmmy RAT to carry out hacking attacks on companies and universities in sectors such as education , job openings , real estate and semiconductors in South Korea . In early August , the SectorJ04 group carried out extensive hacking activities targeting the users around the world , including South Korea , India , Britain , the United States , Germany , Canada , Argentina , Bangladesh and Hong Kong . Spam emails targeting email accounts used in the integrated mail service of public officials were also found in the hacking activity . They are one of the most active cyber crime groups in 2019 , and they often modify and tweak their hacking methods and perform periodic hacking activities . Now , Silence is one of the most active threat actors targeting the financial sector . Since we released our original report , Silence: Moving into the darkside , the confirmed damage from Silence's operations has increased fivefold compared to the figures in Group-IB's initial report . Silence started by targeting organizations in Russia , gradually shifting their focus to former Soviet countries , and then the world . Silence also started using Ivoke , a fileless loader , and EDA agent , both written in PowerShell . Silence 2.0: Going Global is an extension of our original report: Silence: Moving into the Darkside which remains the most significant contribution to the research on the group and is the first such report to reveal Silence’s activity . Since the report’s release in September 2018 , Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence team has detected 16 campaigns targeting banks launched by Silence . Like the majority of APT groups , Silence uses phishing as their infection vector . In the last successful attack described in Silence: Moving into the darkside , dated April 2018 , the hackers siphoned off about $150 , 000 through ATMs in a single night . Prior to April 2018 , as described in Group-IB’s Silence: Moving into the darkside report , Silence’s target interests were primarily limited to former Soviet and Eastern European countries including Russia , Ukraine , Belarus , Azerbaijan , Poland , and Kazakhstan . In 2018 , Silence conducted test campaigns to update their database of current targets and expand their attack geography . The threat actor’s emails usually contain a picture or a link without a malicious payload and are sent out to a huge recipient database of up to 85 , 000 users . Silence has conducted at least three campaigns using recon emails , followed by malicious mail sent to an updated recipient list . Group-IB has also detected recon emails sent out to New Zealand . Since our last public report , Silence has sent out more than 170 , 000 recon emails to banks in Russia , the former Soviet Union , Asia and Europe . In November 2018 , Silence tried their hand at targeting the Asian market for the first time in their history . In total , Silence sent out about 80 , 000 emails , with more than half of them targeting Taiwan , Malaysia , and South Korea . Prior to April 2018 , as described in Group-IB’s Silence: Moving into the darkside report , Silence’s target interests were primarily limited to former Soviet and Eastern European countries including Russia , Ukraine , Belarus , Azerbaijan , Poland , and Kazakhstan . From 16 October 2018 to 1 January 2019 , Silence sent out about 84 , 000 emails in Russia alone to update their address database . As part of their phishing campaigns , silence still uses Microsoft Office documents with macros or exploits , CHM files , and .lNK shortcuts as malicious attachments .",1,"Backdoors are installed in infected systems and SectorJ04 also distributed email stealers , botnet malware and ransomware through those backdoors .

In late July , SectorJ04 group used FlawedAmmy RAT to carry out hacking attacks on companies and universities in sectors such as education , job openings , real estate and semiconductors in South Korea . In early August , the SectorJ04 group carried out extensive hacking activities targeting the users around the world , including South Korea , India , Britain , the United States , Germany , Canada , Argentina , Bangladesh and Hong Kong . Spam emails targeting email accounts used in the integrated mail service of public officials were also found in the hacking activity . They are one of the most active cyber crime groups in 2019 , and they often modify and tweak their hacking methods and perform periodic hacking activities . Now , Silence is one of the most active threat actors targeting the financial sector . Since we released our original report , Silence: Moving into the darkside , the confirmed damage from Silence's operations has increased fivefold compared to the figures in Group-IB's initial report . Silence started by targeting organizations in Russia , gradually shifting their focus to former Soviet countries , and then the world . Silence also started using Ivoke , a fileless loader , and EDA agent , both written in PowerShell . Silence 2.0: Going Global is an extension of our original report: Silence: Moving into the Darkside which remains the most significant contribution to the research on the group and is the first such report to reveal Silence’s activity . Since the report’s release in September 2018 , Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence team has detected 16 campaigns targeting banks launched by Silence . Like the majority of APT groups , Silence uses phishing as their infection vector . In the last successful attack described in Silence: Moving into the darkside , dated April 2018 , the hackers siphoned off about $150 , 000 through ATMs in a single night . Prior to April 2018 , as described in Group-IB’s Silence: Moving into the darkside report , Silence’s target interests were primarily limited to former Soviet and Eastern European countries including Russia , Ukraine , Belarus , Azerbaijan , Poland , and Kazakhstan . In 2018 , Silence conducted test campaigns to update their database of current targets and expand their attack geography . The threat actor’s emails usually contain a picture or a link without a malicious payload and are sent out to a huge recipient database of up to 85 , 000 users . Silence has conducted at least three campaigns using recon emails , followed by malicious mail sent to an updated recipient list . Group-IB has also detected recon emails sent out to New Zealand . Since our last public report , Silence has sent out more than 170 , 000 recon emails to banks in Russia , the former Soviet Union , Asia and Europe . In November 2018 , Silence tried their hand at targeting the Asian market for the first time in their history . In total , Silence sent out about 80 , 000 emails , with more than half of them targeting Taiwan , Malaysia , and South Korea . Prior to April 2018 , as described in Group-IB’s Silence: Moving into the darkside report , Silence’s target interests were primarily limited to former Soviet and Eastern European countries including Russia , Ukraine , Belarus , Azerbaijan , Poland , and Kazakhstan . From 16 October 2018 to 1 January 2019 , Silence sent out about 84 , 000 emails in Russia alone to update their address database . As part of their phishing campaigns , silence still uses Microsoft Office documents with macros or exploits , CHM files , and .lNK shortcuts as malicious attachments ."

"Booz Allen Hamilton in 2014 and AhnLab in 2015 reported on Bisonal using a simple XOR cipher to hide the C2 address strings in the body . For example , Bisonal malware in 2012 used send() and recv() APIs to communicate with its C2. This Bisonal variant used in the latest attack communicates with one of the following hard-coded C2 addresses by using the HTTP POST method on TCP PROT 443 . Previous reports have discussed Bisonal malware used in attacks against Japan , South Korea and Russia .

"In some instances , APT41 leveraged POISONPLUG as a first-stage backdoor to deploy the HIGHNOON backdoor in the targeted environment .

APT41 sent spear-phishing emails to multiple HR employees three days after the compromise had been remediated and systems were brought back online . APT41 also deploys the SOGU and CROSSWALK malware families as means to maintain presence . Within hours of a user opening the malicious attachment dropping a HOMEUNIX backdoor , APT41 regained a foothold within the environment by installing PHOTO on the organization's servers across multiple geographic regions . Before attempting to deploy the publicly available Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) Encryptor RaaS through group policy , APT41 blocked victim systems from retrieving anti-virus updates by accessing the DNS management console and implementing a forward lookup on the domain used for anti-virus updates to the park IP address 1.1.1.1 . APT41 has been observed creating a RAR archive of targeted files for Exfiltration . APT41 is unique among tracked China-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware typically reserved for espionage campaigns in what appears to be activity for personal gain . During multiple engagements , APT41 attempted to remove evidence of some of its activity by deleting Bash histories , clearing Windows security and system events , and modifying DNS management to avoid anti-virus detections . Explicit financially-motivated targeting is unusual among Chinese statesponsored threat groups , and evidence suggests APT41 has conducted simultaneous cyber crime and Cyber Espionage operations from 2014 onward . APT41 operations against higher education , travel services , and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance . For example , the group has repeatedly targeted call record information at telecom companies . APT41 has established and maintained strategic access to organizations in the healthcare , high-tech , and telecommunications sectors . The group’s financially motivated activity has primarily focused on the video game industry , where APT41 has manipulated virtual currencies and even attempted to deploy ransomware . In another instance , APT41 targeted a hotel’s reservation systems ahead of Chinese officials staying there , suggesting the group was tasked to reconnoiter the facility for security reasons . These supply chain compromise tactics have also been characteristic of APT41’s best known and most recent espionage campaigns . Interestingly , despite the significant effort required to execute supply chain compromises and the large number of affected organizations , APT41 limits the deployment of follow-on malware to specific victim systems by matching against individual system identifiers . Mapping the group’s activities since 2012 (Figure 2) also provides some indication that APT41 primarily conducts financially motivated operations outside of their normal day jobs . The latter is especially notable because APT41 has repeatedly returned to targeting the video game industry and we believe these activities were formative in the group’s later espionage operations . APT41 leverages an arsenal of over 46 different malware families and tools to accomplish their missions , including publicly available utilities , malware shared with other Chinese espionage operations , and tools unique to the group .

Dexphot is not the type of attack that generates mainstream media attention ; it ’s one of the countless malware campaigns that are active at any given time .,1,Dexphot is not the type of attack that generates mainstream media attention ; it ’s one of the countless malware campaigns that are active at any given time .
"Both in the attacks against ITUC and in other occasions , Operation Kingphish approached selected targets over social media , prominently Facebook , and engaged in chat conversations with them on and off , sometimes over a period of several months . This time the document purported to be about the involvement of the Emir of Qatar in funding ISIS , which was seemingly copied from a website critical of Qatar . While there is a clear underlying Qatar migrant workers theme in Operation Sheep , it is also hypothetically possible that these attacks could have been perpetrated by a malicious actor affiliated to a different government with an interest in damaging the reputation of the State of Qatar . Dubbed ‘Operation Sheep’ , this massive data stealing campaign is the first known campaign seen in the wild to exploit the Man-in-the-Disk vulnerability revealed by Check Point Research earlier last year . The SDK , named SWAnalytics is integrated into seemingly innocent Android applications published on major 3rd party Chinese app stores such as Tencent MyApp , Wandoujia , Huawei App Store , and Xiaomi App Store . After app installation , whenever SWAnalytics senses victims opening up infected applications or rebooting their phones , it silently uploads their entire contacts list to Hangzhou Shun Wang Technologies controlled servers . In theory , Shun Wang Technologies could have collected a third of China’s population names and contact numbers if not more . With no clear declaration of usage from Shun Wang , nor proper regulatory supervision , such data could circulate into underground markets for further exploit , ranging from rogue marketing , targeted telephone scams or even friend referral program abuse during November’s Single’s Day and December’s Asian online shopping fest . This paper will cover the discovery of this campaign , dubbed ‘Operation Sheep’ , and an analysis of SWAnalytics . In mid-September , an app named ‘Network Speed Master’ stood out on our radar with its rather unusual behavior patterns . This module monitors a wide range of device activities including application installation / remove / update , phone restart and battery charge . It turns out that contacts data isn’t the only unusual data SWAnalytics is interested in . With default settings , SWAnalytics will scan through an Android device’s external storage , looking for directory tencent/MobileQQ/WebViewCheck” . From our first malicious sample encounter back in mid-September until now , we have observed 12 infected applications , the majority of which are in the system utility category . By listing sub-folders , SWAnalytics is able to infer QQ accounts which have never been used on the device . Operation Sheep is the first campaign we have observed in the wild that abuses similar concept since our MitD publication . To make this data harvesting operation flexible , SWAnalytics equips the ability to receive and process configuration files from a remote Command-and-Control . Whenever users reboot their device or open up Network Speed Master , SWAnalytics will fetch the latest configuration file from http[:]//mbl[.]shunwang[.]com/cfg/config[.]json” . In order to understand SWAnalytics’ impact , we turned to public download volume data available on Chandashi , one of the app store optimization vendors specialized in Chinese mobile application markets . Data points span from September 2018 to January 2019 where we observed over 17 million downloads in just five months . In China alone , we have seen underground market sheep shavers” ported SMS rogue marketing strategy to spread Alipay Red Packet referral URL links . In Operation Sheep’s case , Shun Wang likely harvests end user contact lists without application developer acknowledgement . According to Cheetah Mobile’s follow-up investigation , fraudulent behaviors came from two 3rd party SDKs Batmobi , Duapps integrated inside Cheetah SDK . It is likely a new campaign or actor started using Panda Banker since in addition to the previously unseen Japanese targeting , Arbor has not seen any indicator of compromise (IOC) overlaps with previous Panda Banker campaigns . Webinjects targeting Japan , a country we haven’t seen targeted by Panda Banker before . Japan is no stranger to banking malware . Based on recent reports , the country has been plagued by attacks using the Ursnif and Urlzone banking malware . This post was our first analysis of the first Panda Banker campaign that we’ve seen to target financial institutions in Japan . Operation Pawn Storm is an active economic and political cyber-espionage operation that targets a wide range of entities , like the military , governments , defense industries , and the media . we believe the iOS malware gets installed on already compromised systems , and it is very similar to next stage SEDNIT malware we have found for Microsoft Windows’ systems . we found two malicious iOS applications in Operation Pawn Storm . One is called XAgent detected as IOS_XAGENT.A and the other one uses the name of a legitimate iOS game , MadCap detected as IOS_ XAGENT.B . The obvious goal of the SEDNIT-related spyware is to steal personal data , record audio , make screenshots , and send them to a remote command-and-control (C&C) server .",1,"Both in the attacks against ITUC and in other occasions , Operation Kingphish approached selected targets over social media , prominently Facebook , and engaged in chat conversations with them on and off , sometimes over a period of several months . This time the document purported to be about the involvement of the Emir of Qatar in funding ISIS , which was seemingly copied from a website critical of Qatar . While there is a clear underlying Qatar migrant workers theme in Operation Sheep , it is also hypothetically possible that these attacks could have been perpetrated by a malicious actor affiliated to a different government with an interest in damaging the reputation of the State of Qatar . Dubbed ‘Operation Sheep’ , this massive data stealing campaign is the first known campaign seen in the wild to exploit the Man-in-the-Disk vulnerability revealed by Check Point Research earlier last year . The SDK , named SWAnalytics is integrated into seemingly innocent Android applications published on major 3rd party Chinese app stores such as Tencent MyApp , Wandoujia , Huawei App Store , and Xiaomi App Store . After app installation , whenever SWAnalytics senses victims opening up infected applications or rebooting their phones , it silently uploads their entire contacts list to Hangzhou Shun Wang Technologies controlled servers . In theory , Shun Wang Technologies could have collected a third of China’s population names and contact numbers if not more . With no clear declaration of usage from Shun Wang , nor proper regulatory supervision , such data could circulate into underground markets for further exploit , ranging from rogue marketing , targeted telephone scams or even friend referral program abuse during November’s Single’s Day and December’s Asian online shopping fest . This paper will cover the discovery of this campaign , dubbed ‘Operation Sheep’ , and an analysis of SWAnalytics . In mid-September , an app named ‘Network Speed Master’ stood out on our radar with its rather unusual behavior patterns . This module monitors a wide range of device activities including application installation / remove / update , phone restart and battery charge . It turns out that contacts data isn’t the only unusual data SWAnalytics is interested in . With default settings , SWAnalytics will scan through an Android device’s external storage , looking for directory tencent/MobileQQ/WebViewCheck” . From our first malicious sample encounter back in mid-September until now , we have observed 12 infected applications , the majority of which are in the system utility category . By listing sub-folders , SWAnalytics is able to infer QQ accounts which have never been used on the device . Operation Sheep is the first campaign we have observed in the wild that abuses similar concept since our MitD publication . To make this data harvesting operation flexible , SWAnalytics equips the ability to receive and process configuration files from a remote Command-and-Control . Whenever users reboot their device or open up Network Speed Master , SWAnalytics will fetch the latest configuration file from http[:]//mbl[.]shunwang[.]com/cfg/config[.]json” .

It fetches the same FlawedAmmyy downloader .msi file , then downloads the FlawedAmmyy payload . TA505 used Wizard (.wiz) files in this campaign , with FlawedAmmyy RAT as the final payload .

"This investigation by the Agari Cyber Intelligence Division into the cybercriminal group we’ve named Scattered Canary offers unprecedented visibility into eleven years of fraud and criminal activities , and the growth of a 419 startup into a fully operational BEC business . While this criminal organization’s activities now center around BEC , and extend to romance scams , credit card fraud , check fraud , fake job listings , credential harvesting , tax schemes , and more , these actors came from much humbler beginnings , starting with basic Craigslist scams in 2008 . On November 29 , 2018 , Scattered Canary sent an attack email to Agari CFO Raymond Lim , enquiring as to his availability to send out a domestic wire transfer . Many feel that they have a home team advantage living in Nigeria , where they are free to pay off law enforcement to look the other ACT . Scattered Canary’s fraudulent history can be traced as far back as October 2008 , when the group first arrived on the cybercriminal circuit . By March 2016 , one of Scattered Canary’s members had built enough trust with a romance victim—who we’ll call Jane—that she became a frequent source of new mule accounts for the group . Alpha’s early role was fairly simple: engage with individuals , who he chose based on the goods they were selling , and then provide personal shipping addresses back to Omega . By all accounts , late 2015 was the beginning of BEC for Scattered Canary . The first type of attack Scattered Canary pivoted to was credential phishing . Between July 2015 and February 2016 , Scattered Canary’s primary focus seemed to be mass harvesting general credentials using a Google Docs phishing page . In the first few months of their credential phishing ventures , Scattered Canary’s sights were mostly set on Asian targets—Malaysia and Japan , in particular . In November 2015 , the group started to focus on North American users , mostly in the United States .

"CVE-2018-0798 is an RCE vulnerability , a stack buffer overflow that can be exploited by a threat actor to perform stack corruption . As observed previously with CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802 , the weaponizer was used exclusively by Chinese Cyber Espionage actors for approximately one year December 2017 through December 2018 , after which cybercrime actors began to incorporate it in their malicious activity . Upon decrypting and executing , it drops two additional files wsc_proxy.exe” (legitimate Avast executable) and a malicious DLL wsc.dll” in the %TEMP% folder . However , Beginning on 25 June 2019 , we started observing multiple commodity campaigns Mostly dropping AsyncRAT using the updated RTF weaponizer with the same exploit ( CVE-2018-0798 ) . Analysis of the Royal Road weaponizer has resulted in the discovery that multiple Chinese threat groups started utilizing CVE-2018-0798 in their RTF weaponizer . These findings also suggest that the threat groups have robust exploit developing capabilities because CVE-2018-0798 is not widely reported on and it is typically not incorporated into publicly available weaponizers . In addition , a current ANY.RUN playback of our observed Elise infection is also available . Upon opening of the MS Word document , our embedded file exploits CVE-2017-11882 to drop a malicious fake Norton Security Shell Extension module , 'NavShExt.dll' , which is then injected into iexplore.exe to install the backdoor , begin collection , and activate command and control . Moving through the infection process , NetWitness Endpoint detects the initial exploit CVE-2017-1182 in action as the Microsoft Equation Editor , 'EQNEDT32.exe' , scores high for potentially malicious activity . Most recently though , a new campaign , targeting Belarus , Turkey and Ukraine , has emerged that caught the attention of Check Point researchers . The well-crafted and socially engineered malicious documents then become the ﬁrst stage of a long and mainly ﬁleless infection chain that eventually delivers POWERSTATS , a signature PowerShell backdoor of this threat group . This powerful backdoor can receive commands from the attackers , enabling it to exﬁltrate ﬁles from the system it is running on , execute additional scripts , delete ﬁles , and more . If the macros in SPK KANUN DEĞİŞİKLİĞİ GİB GÖRÜŞÜ.doc” are enabled , an embedded payload is decoded and saved in the %APPDATA% directory with the name CiscoAny.exe” . INF ﬁles have been used in the past by MuddyWater , although they were launched using Advpack.dll and not IEAdvpack.dll . In addition , by using VBA2Graph , we were able to visualize the VBA call graph in the macros of each document . Although it has focused most of its efforts on the Middle East region , the political afﬁliations , motives and purposes behind MuddyWater’s attacks are not very well- deﬁned , thus earning it its name . In the past , countries such as Saudi Arabia , the UAE and Turkey have been a MuddyWater's main target , but the campaigns have also reached a much wider audience , making their ACT to victims in countries such as Belarus and Ukraine . MuddyWater target groups across Middle East and Central Asia , primarily using spear phishing emails with malicious attachments . Most recently MuddyWater were connected to a campaign in March that targeted organizations in Turkey , Pakistan , and Tajikistan . The group has been quite visible since the initial 2017 Malwarebytes report on their elaborate espionage attack against the Saudi Arabian government . Our analysis revealed that they drop a new backdoor , which is written in PowerShell as MuddyWater’s known POWERSTATS backdoor . We assume that RunPow stands for run PowerShell , ” and triggers the PowerShell code embedded inside the .dll file . This backdoor has some features similar to a previously discovered version of the Muddywater backdoor . Based on our analysis , we can confirm that MuddyWater target Turkish government organizations related to the finance and energy sectors . This is yet another similarity with previous MuddyWater campaigns , which were known to have targeted multiple Turkish government entities . The main delivery method of this type of backdoor is spear phishing emails or spam that uses social engineering to manipulate targets into enabling malicious documents . Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ provides detection , in-depth analysis , and proactive response to today’s stealthy malware , and targeted attacks in real time . MuddyWater first surfaced in 2017 . First stage infections and graphical decoys have been described by multiple sources , including in our previous research MuddyWater expands operations . MuddyWater compiles various offensive Python scripts . This includes Python scripts . Usually , the Stageless Meterpreter has the Ext_server_stdapi.x64.dll” , Ext_server_extapi.x64.dll” , and Ext_server_espia.x64.dll” extensions . The January 2017 report followed up on other private reports published on the group’s BeEF-related activity in 2015 and 2016 . Previous analysis of the NewsBeef APT indicates that the group focuses on Saudi Arabian and Western targets , and lacks advanced offensive technology development capabilities . However , in the summer of 2016 , NewsBeef deployed a new toolset that includes macro-enabled Office documents , PowerSploit , and the Pupy backdoor . The most recent NewsBeef campaign uses this toolset in conjunction with spearphishing emails , links sent over social media/standalone private messaging applications , and watering hole attacks that leverage compromised high-profile websites some belonging to the SA government . The NewsBeef actor deployed a new toolset in a campaign that focused primarily on Saudi Arabian targets . NewsBeef continues to deploy malicious macro-enabled Office documents , poisoned legitimate Flash and Chrome installers , PowerSploit , and Pupy tools . The NewsBeef campaign is divided into two main attack vectors , spearphishing and strategic web compromise watering hole attacks . On December 25 , 2016 , the NewsBeef APT stood up a server to host a new set of Microsoft Office documents (maintaining malicious macros and PowerShell scripts) to support its spear-phishing operations . These compromised servers include Saudi Arabian government servers and other high-value organizational identities relevant to NewsBeef's targets . However , Kaspersky Security Network records also contain links that victims clicked from the Outlook web client outlook.live.com” as well as attachments arriving through the Outlook desktop application . Interestingly , NewsBeef set up its server using the hosting provider Choopa , LLC , US” , the same hosting provider that the group used in attacks over the summer of 2016 . NTG’s IT focus and client list likely aided NewsBeef’s delivery of malicious PowerShell-enabled Office documents and poisoned installers . In other schemes , NewsBeef sent macro-enabled Office attachments from spoofed law firm identities or other relevant service providers to targets in SA . The law firm in this scheme is based in the United Kingdom and is the sole location for targets outside of SA for this campaign . Starting in October 2016 , NewsBeef compromised a set of legitimate servers (shown below) , and injected JavaScript to redirect visitors to http://analytics-google.org:69/Check.aspx . For example , on a Saudi government website , the NewsBeef APT delivered packed JavaScript into the bottom of a referenced script that is included in every page served from the site the packed and unpacked JavaScript is shown below . The JavaScript forces visiting web browsers to collect and send (via a POST request) web browser , browser version , country of origin , and IP address data to the attacker controlled server jquerycodedownload.live/check.aspx” . A high volume of redirections from the compromised site continues into mid-January 2017 . However , as this recent campaign indicates , the NewsBeef APT appears to have shifted its intrusion toolset aACT from BeEF and towards macro-enabled malicious Office documents , PowerSploit , and Pupy . Despite this shift in toolset , the group still relies on old infrastructure as evidenced by their reuse of servers hosted by the service providers Choopa and Atlantic.net . Its attack activities can be traced back to April 2012 . The OceanLotus reflects a very strong confrontational ability and willing to attack by keep evolving their techniques . These APT attacks and adopting confrontation measures will exist for a long time . OceanLotus’ targets are global . OceanLotus have been actively using since at least early 2018 . OceanLotus malware family samples used no earlier than 2017 . we identified two methods to deliver the KerrDown downloader to targets . The link to the final payload of KerrDown was still active during the time of analysis and hence we were able to download a copy which turned out to be a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon . While investigating KerrDown we found multiple RAR files containing a variant of the malware . Therefore , it is clear that the OceanLotus group works during weekdays and takes a break during the weekends . The group was first revealed and named by SkyEye Team in May 2015 . OceanLotus's targets include China's maritime institutions , maritime construction , scientific research institutes and shipping enterprises .",1,"[CVE] is an RCE vulnerability , a stack buffer overflow that can be exploited by a threat actor to perform stack corruption . As observed previously with [CVE] and [CVE] , the weaponizer was used exclusively by Chinese Cyber Espionage actors for approximately one year December 2017 through December 2018 , after which cybercrime actors began to incorporate it in their malicious activity . Upon decrypting and executing , it drops two additional files wsc_proxy.exe” (legitimate Avast executable) and a malicious DLL wsc.dll” in the %TEMP% folder . However , Beginning on 25 June 2019 , we started observing multiple commodity campaigns Mostly dropping AsyncRAT using the updated RTF weaponizer with the same exploit ( [CVE] ) . Analysis of the Royal Road weaponizer has resulted in the discovery that multiple Chinese threat groups started utilizing [CVE] in their RTF weaponizer . These findings also suggest that the threat groups have robust exploit developing capabilities because [CVE] is not widely reported on and it is typically not incorporated into publicly available weaponizers . In addition , a current ANY.RUN playback of our observed Elise infection is also available . Upon opening of the MS Word document , our embedded file exploits [CVE] to drop a malicious fake Norton Security Shell Extension module , 'NavShExt.dll' , which is then injected into iexplore.exe to install the backdoor , begin collection , and activate command and control . Moving through the infection process , NetWitness Endpoint detects the initial exploit [CVE] in action as the Microsoft Equation Editor , 'EQNEDT32.exe' , scores high for potentially malicious activity . Most recently though , a new campaign , targeting Belarus , Turkey and Ukraine , has emerged that caught the attention of Check Point researchers . The well-crafted and socially engineered malicious documents then become the ﬁrst stage of a long and mainly ﬁleless infection chain that eventually delivers POWERSTATS , a signature PowerShell backdoor of this threat group . This powerful backdoor can receive commands from the attackers , enabling it to exﬁltrate ﬁles from the system it is running on , execute additional scripts , delete ﬁles , and more . If the macros in SPK KANUN DEĞİŞİKLİĞİ GİB GÖRÜŞÜ.doc” are enabled , an embedded payload is decoded and saved in the %APPDATA% directory with the name CiscoAny.exe” . INF ﬁles have been used in the past by MuddyWater , although they were launched using Advpack.dll and not IEAdvpack.dll . In addition , by using VBA2Graph , we were able to visualize the VBA call graph in the macros of each document . Although it has focused most of its efforts on the Middle East region , the political afﬁliations , motives and purposes behind MuddyWater’s attacks are not very well- deﬁned , thus earning it its name . In the past , countries such as Saudi Arabia , the UAE and Turkey have been a MuddyWater's main target , but the campaigns have also reached a much wider audience , making their ACT to victims in countries such as Belarus and Ukraine . MuddyWater target groups across Middle East and Central Asia , primarily using spear phishing emails with malicious attachments . Most recently MuddyWater were connected to a campaign in March that targeted organizations in Turkey , Pakistan , and Tajikistan . The group has been quite visible since the initial 2017 Malwarebytes report on their elaborate espionage attack against the Saudi Arabian government . Our analysis revealed that they drop a new backdoor , which is written in PowerShell as MuddyWater’s known POWERSTATS backdoor . We assume that RunPow stands for run PowerShell , ” and triggers the PowerShell code embedded inside the .dll file . This backdoor has some features similar to a previously discovered version of the Muddywater backdoor . Based on our analysis , we can confirm that MuddyWater target Turkish government organizations related to the finance and energy sectors . This is yet another similarity with previous MuddyWater campaigns , which were known to have targeted multiple Turkish government entities . The main delivery method of this type of backdoor is spear phishing emails or spam that uses social engineering to manipulate targets into enabling malicious documents . Trend Micro Deep Discovery provides detection , in-depth analysis , and proactive response to today’s stealthy malware , and targeted attacks in real time . MuddyWater first surfaced in 2017 . First stage infections and graphical decoys have been described by multiple sources , including in our previous research MuddyWater expands operations . MuddyWater compiles various offensive Python scripts . This includes Python scripts . Usually , the Stageless Meterpreter has the Ext_server_stdapi.x64.dll” , Ext_server_extapi.x64.dll” , and Ext_server_espia.x64.dll” extensions . The January 2017 report followed up on other private reports published on the group’s BeEF-related activity in 2015 and 2016 . Previous analysis of the NewsBeef APT indicates that the group focuses on Saudi Arabian and Western targets , and lacks advanced offensive technology development capabilities . However , in the summer of 2016 , NewsBeef deployed a new toolset that includes macro-enabled Office documents , PowerSploit , and the Pupy backdoor . The most recent NewsBeef campaign uses this toolset in conjunction with spearphishing emails , links sent over social media/standalone private messaging applications , and watering hole attacks that leverage compromised high-profile websites some belonging to the SA government . The NewsBeef actor deployed a new toolset in a campaign that focused primarily on Saudi Arabian targets . NewsBeef continues to deploy malicious macro-enabled Office documents , poisoned legitimate Flash and Chrome installers , PowerSploit , and Pupy tools . The NewsBeef campaign is divided into two main attack vectors , spearphishing and strategic web compromise watering hole attacks . On December 25 , 2016 , the NewsBeef APT stood up a server to host a new set of Microsoft Office documents (maintaining malicious macros and PowerShell scripts) to support its spear-phishing operations . These compromised servers include Saudi Arabian government servers and other high-value organizational identities relevant to NewsBeef's targets . However , Kaspersky Security Network records also contain links that victims clicked from the Outlook web client [DOMAIN]” as well as attachments arriving through the Outlook desktop application . Interestingly , NewsBeef set up its server using the hosting provider Choopa , LLC , US” , the same hosting provider that the group used in attacks over the summer of 2016 . NTG’s IT focus and client list likely aided NewsBeef’s delivery of malicious PowerShell-enabled Office documents and poisoned installers . In other schemes , NewsBeef sent macro-enabled Office attachments from spoofed law firm identities or other relevant service providers to targets in SA . The law firm in this scheme is based in the United Kingdom and is the sole location for targets outside of SA for this campaign . Starting in October 2016 , NewsBeef compromised a set of legitimate servers (shown below) , and injected JavaScript to redirect visitors to [URL] . For example , on a Saudi government website , the NewsBeef APT delivered packed JavaScript into the bottom of a referenced script that is included in every page served from the site the packed and unpacked JavaScript is shown below . The JavaScript forces visiting web browsers to collect and send (via a POST request) web browser , browser version , country of origin , and IP address data to the attacker controlled server jquerycodedownload.live/check.aspx” . A high volume of redirections from the compromised site continues into mid-January 2017 . However , as this recent campaign indicates , the NewsBeef APT appears to have shifted its intrusion toolset aACT from BeEF and towards macro-enabled malicious Office documents , PowerSploit , and Pupy . Despite this shift in toolset , the group still relies on old infrastructure as evidenced by their reuse of servers hosted by the service providers Choopa and [DOMAIN] . Its attack activities can be traced back to April 2012 . The OceanLotus reflects a very strong confrontational ability and willing to attack by keep evolving their techniques . These APT attacks and adopting confrontation measures will exist for a long time . OceanLotus’ targets are global . OceanLotus have been actively using since at least early 2018 . OceanLotus malware family samples used no earlier than 2017 . we identified two methods to deliver the KerrDown downloader to targets . The link to the final payload of KerrDown was still active during the time of analysis and hence we were able to download a copy which turned out to be a variant of Cobalt Strike Beacon . While investigating KerrDown we found multiple RAR files containing a variant of the malware . Therefore , it is clear that the OceanLotus group works during weekdays and takes a break during the weekends . The group was first revealed and named by SkyEye Team in May 2015 . OceanLotus's targets include China's maritime institutions , maritime construction , scientific research institutes and shipping enterprises ."

"APT41 has also deployed rootkits and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits on a limited basis to hide their malware and maintain persistence on select victim systems . The limited use of these tools by APT41 suggests the group reserves more advanced TTPs and malware only for high-value targets . Like other Chinese espionage operators , APT41 appears to have moved toward strategic intelligence collection and establishing access and aACT from direct intellectual property theft since 2015 . This shift , however , has not affected the group's consistent interest in targeting the video game industry for financially motivated reasons . BalkanRAT enables the attacker to remotely control the compromised computer via a graphical interface , i.e. , manually; BalkanDoor enables them to remotely control the compromised computer via a command line , i.e. , possibly en masse . With the contents of the emails , included links and decoy PDFs all involving taxes , the attackers are apparently targeting the financial departments of organizations in the Balkans region . Some parts of the campaign were briefly described by a Serbian security provider in 2016 and the Croatian CERT in 2017 . The campaign has been active at least from January 2016 to the time of writing the most recent detections in our telemetry are from July 2019 . Our findings show that the mentioned attacks have been orchestrated and we consider them a single long-term campaign that spans Croatia , Serbia , Montenegro , and Bosnia and Herzegovina . We’ve discovered a new version of BalkanDoor with a new method for execution/installation: an exploit of the WinRAR ACE vulnerability CVE-2018-20250 . Both BalkanRAT and BalkanDoor spread in Croatia , Serbia , Montenegro , and Bosnia and Herzegovina . According to our telemetry , the campaign spreading these tools has been live since 2016 , with the most recent detections as late as in July 2019 . In some of the latest samples of BalkanDoor detected in 2019 , the malware is distributed as an ACE archive , disguised as a RAR archive (i.e. , not an executable file) , specially crafted to exploit the WinRAR ACE vulnerability CVE-2018-20250 . Via the BalkanDoor backdoor , the attacker sends a backdoor command to unlock the screen… and using BalkanRAT , they can do whatever they want on the computer . The BalkanDoor backdoor does not implement any Exfiltration channel . APT41 leveraged ADORE.XSEC , a Linux backdoor launched by the Adore-NG rootkit , throughout an organization's Linux environment . The backdoor can connect to any of the C&Cs from a hardcoded list – a measure to increase resilience . The main part of the BalkanRAT malware is a copy of the Remote Utilities software for remote access . Interestingly , some of the APT41's POISONPLUG malware samples leverage the Steam Community website associated with Valve , a video game developer and publisher . The campaign targeting accountants in the Balkans shows some similarities with a campaign aimed at Ukrainian notaries reported in 2016 . Based on the Let’s Encrypt certificate issuance date , we believe this campaign to be active from May 2019 . One of the domains uncovered during the investigation was identified by the Chinese security vendor CERT 360 as being part of the BITTER APT campaign in May 2019 . Further analysis of the BITTER APT’s infrastructure uncovered a broader phishing campaign targeting other government sites and state-owned enterprises in China . Further investigation revealed approximately 40 additional sites , all of which appear to be targeting the government of China and other organisations in China . We expect to see BITTER APT continuing to target the government of China by employing spoofed login pages designed to steal user credentials and obtain access to privileged account information . This domain and IP address has been previously associated with the BITTER APT and targeting government agencies in China with phishing attacks , based on reporting from 360-CERT . At the time of analysis , the subdomains did not host a website; however , based on BITTER APT group’s targeting patterns , it is highly likely that they were created to host faux login phishing pages designed to steal user’s credentials . BITTER APT campaigns are primarily targeting China , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia historically . As part of its ongoing research initiatives , the Anomali Threat Research Team has discovered a new phishing attack leveraging spoof sites that seem to be designed to steal email credentials from the target victims within the government of the People’s Republic of China . 360 Threat Intelligence Center has reported on related indicators being attributed to BITTER APT a South Asian country suspected Indian APT in open source reporting . China Chopper is a tool that has been used by some state-sponsored actors such as Leviathan and Threat Group-3390 , but during our investigation we've seen actors with varying skill levels . China Chopper is a tool that allows attackers to remotely control the target system that needs to be running a web server application before it can be targeted by the tool . Cisco Talos discovered significant China Chopper activity over a two-year period beginning in June 2017 , which shows that even nine years after its creation , attackers are using China Chopper without significant modifications . Here , we investigate a campaign targeting an Asian government organization . We observed another campaign targeting an organisation located in Lebanon . China Chopper contains a remote shell ( Virtual Terminal ) function that has a first suggested command of netstat an|find ESTABLISHED . They download and install an archive containing executables and trivially modified source code of the password-stealing tool Mimikatz Lite as GetPassword.exe . The tool investigates the Local Security Authority Subsystem memory space in order to find , decrypt and display retrieved passwords . The actor attempts to exploit CVE-2018–8440 — an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows when it improperly handles calls to Advanced Local Procedure Call — to elevate the privileges using a modified proof-of-concept exploit . The attacker obtains the required privileges and launches a few other tools to modify the access control lists (ACLs) of all websites running on the affected server . The Windows branch of the Cloud Atlas intrusion set still uses spear-phishing emails to target high profile victims . From the beginning of 2019 until July , we have been able to identify different spear-phishing campaigns related to this threat actor mostly focused on Russia , Central Asia and regions of Ukraine with ongoing military conflicts . We described one of the techniques used by Cloud Atlas in 2017 and our colleagues at Palo Alto Networks also wrote about it in November 2018 . The China Chopper actor activity starts with the download and execution of two exploit files which attempt to exploit the Windows vulnerabilities CVE-2015-0062 , CVE-2015-1701 and CVE-2016-0099 to allow the attacker to modify other objects on the server . Previously , Cloud Atlas dropped its validator” implant named PowerShower” directly , after exploiting the Microsoft Equation vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 mixed with CVE-2018-0802 . This malware has been used since October 2018 by Cloud Atlas as a validator and now as a second stage . Cloud Atlas remains very prolific in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . During its recent campaigns , Cloud Atlas used a new polymorphic” infection chain relying no more on PowerShower directly after infection , but executing a polymorphic HTA hosted on a remote server , which is used to drop three different files on the local system . The Gamaredon Group has been actively launching spear-phishing attacks against Ukrainian government and military departments from the mid-2013s . In addition , the anonymous cybersecurity experts referenced in the article connected the malicious Gamaredon Group actors with Russian state-sponsored hackers . In one article published in the Kharkiv Observer – an independent Ukranian online publication – an unnamed source stated that even the Ukrainian Presidential Administration has been attacked by malware developed by the Gamaredon Group . Gamaredon Group primarily target Ukrainian organizations and resources using spear-phishing attacks , and they use military or similar documents as bait . Once they have found a victim , they then deploy remote manipulation system binaries (RMS) via self-extracting archives and batch command files . The following archive caught our attention for exploiting a WinRAR unacev2 module vulnerability and for having interesting content . During a recent incident response investigation , our team identified new attacks by the financially motivated attack group ITG08 , also known as FIN6 . More recently , ITG08 has been observed targeting e-commerce environments by injecting malicious code into online checkout pages of compromised websites — a technique known as online skimming — thereby stealing payment card data transmitted to the vendor by unsuspecting customers . This tool , a TTP observed in ITG08 attacks since 2018 , is sold on the dark web by an underground malware-as-a-service (MaaS) provider . ITG08 is an organized cybercrime gang that has been active since 2015 , mostly targeting pointof-sale (POS) machines in brick-and-mortar retailers and companies in the hospitality sector in the U.S. and Europe . Past campaigns by ITG08 using the More_eggs backdoor were last reported in February 2019 . Attackers use it to create , expand and cement their foothold in compromised environments . Lastly , ITG08 used Comodo code-signing certificates several times during the course of the campaign . Let’s take a closer look at ITG08’s TTPs that are relevant to the campaign we investigated , starting with its spear phishing and intrusion tactics and covering information on its use of the More_eggs backdoor . Additional capabilities of the More_eggs malware include the download and execution of files and scripts and running commands using cmd.exe . X-Force IRIS determined that the More_eggs backdoor later downloaded additional files , including a signed binary shellcode loader and a signed Dynamic Link Library ( DLL ) , as described below , to create a reverse shell and connect to a remote host . Once the ITG08 established a foothold on the network , they employed WMI and PowerShell techniques to perform network reconnaissance and move laterally within the environment . The attackers used this technique to remotely install a Metasploit reverse TCP stager on select systems , subsequently spawning a Meterpreter session and Mimikatz . In addition to the More_eggs malware , ITG08 leveraged in-memory attacks by injecting malicious code , in this case Mimikatz , into legitimate system processes . A recently rising attack tool in ITG08 campaigns has been the More_eggs JScript backdoor . Mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool that allows attackers to extract credentials from volatile memory . After a successful phishing attack in which users have opened emails and browsed to malicious links , ITG08 attackers install the More_eggs JScript backdoor on user devices alongside several other malware components . Beyond using More_eggs as a backdoor , ITG08 in this campaign also used offensive security tools and PowerShell scripts to carry out the different stages of the attack . After injecting Meterpreter into memory , the attacker had complete control of the infected device . IBM X-Force IRIS has gained insight into ITG08’s intrusion methods , ability to navigate laterally , use of custom and open-source tools , and typical persistence mechanisms . After the phishing email resulted in a successful infiltration , ITG08 used the More_eggs backdoor to gain a foothold and infect additional devices . In addition , configuring PowerShell script logging and identifying any obfuscation will assist in mitigating ITG08’s use of PowerShell to conduct malicious activity . The LYCEUM threat group targets organizations in sectors of strategic national importance , including oil and gas and possibly telecommunications . CTU research indicates that LYCEUM may have been active as early as April 2018 . In May 2019 , the threat group launched a campaign against oil and gas organizations in the Middle East . This campaign followed a sharp uptick in development and testing of their toolkit against a public multivendor malware scanning service in February 2019 . Stylistically , the observed tradecraft resembles activity from groups such as COBALT GYPSY (which is related to OilRig , Crambus , and APT34 and COBALT TRINITY also known as Elfin and APT33 . When CTU researchers first published information about LYCEUM to Secureworks Threat Intelligence clients , no public documentation on the group existed . Using compromised accounts , LYCEUM send spearphishing emails with malicious Excel attachments to deliver the DanBot malware , which subsequently deploys post-intrusion tools . The developer consistently used Accept-Enconding” (note the extra ‘n’) in all DanBot samples analyzed by CTU researchers . Get-LAPSP.ps1 is a PowerShell script that gathers account information from Active Directory via LDAP . LYCEUM deployed this tool via DanBot shortly after gaining initial access to a compromised environment . LYCEUM delivers weaponized maldocs via spearphishing from the compromised accounts to the targeted executives , human resources (HR) staff , and IT personnel . This focus on training aligns with LYCEUM’s targeting of executives , HR staff , and IT personnel . Despite the initial perception that the maldoc sample was intended for ICS or OT staff , LYCEUM has not demonstrated an interest in those environments . However , CTU researchers cannot dismiss the possibility that the LYCEUM could seek access to OT environments after establishing robust access to the IT environment . LYCEUM is an emerging threat to energy organizations in the Middle East , but organizations should not assume that future targeting will be limited to this sector . Aside from deploying novel malware , LYCEUM’s activity demonstrates capabilities CTU researchers have observed from other threat groups and reinforces the value of a few key controls . Password spraying , DNS tunneling , social engineering , and abuse of security testing frameworks are common tactics , particularly from threat groups operating in the Middle East . The group behind these attacks has stolen gigabytes of confidential documents , mostly from military organizations . Machete is still very active at the time of this publication , regularly introducing changes to its malware , infrastructure and spearphishing campaigns . ESET has been tracking a new version of Machete (the group’s Python-based toolset) that was first seen in April 2018 . This extends to other countries in Latin America , with the Ecuadorean military being another organization highly targeted with the Machete malware . Their long run of attacks , focused on Latin American countries , has allowed them to collect intelligence and refine their tactics over the years . Machete is interested in files that describe navigation routes and positioning using military grids . The Machete group sends very specific emails directly to its victims , and these change from target to target . The Machete group is very active and has introduced several changes to its malware since a new version was released in April 2018 . Previous versions were described by Kaspersky in 2014 and Cylance in 2017 . Since August 2018 , the Machete components have been delivered with an extra layer of obfuscation . The GoogleUpdate.exe component is responsible for communicating with the remote C&C server . ESET has been tracking this threat for months and has observed several changes , sometimes within weeks . This ACT , the malware can have its configuration , malicious binaries and file listings updated , but can also download and execute other binaries . The presence of code to exfiltrate data to removable drives when there is physical access to a compromised computer may indicate that Machete operators could have a presence in one of the targeted countries , although we cannot be certain . This group is very active and continues to develop new features for its malware , and implement infrastructure changes in 2019 . Machete's long run of attacks , focused in Latin American countries , has allowed them to collect intelligence and refine their tactics over the years . ESET researchers have detected an ongoing , highly targeted campaign , with a majority of the targets being military organizations . The group behind Machete uses effective spearphishing techniques . First described by Kaspersky in 2014 [1] and later , by Cylance in 2017 [2] , Machete is a piece of malware found to be targeting high profile individuals and organizations in Latin American countries . In 2018 Machete reappeared with new code and new features . As of June 2019 , ESET has seen over 50 victims being actively spied upon by Machete , with more than half of them being computers belonging to the Venezuelan military forces . Machete has Latin American targets and has been developed by a Spanish-speaking group , presumably from a LATAM country . Machete was active and constantly working on very effective spearphishing campaigns . In some cases , Machete trick new victims by sending real documents that had been stolen on the very same day . Machete relies on spearphishing to compromise its targets . They seem to have specialized knowledge about military operations , as they are focused on stealing specific files such as those that describe navigation routes . Attackers take advantage of that , along with their knowledge of military jargon and etiquette , to craft very convincing phishing emails . Operators behind Machete apparently already have information about individuals or organizations of interest to them in Latin America , how to reach them , and how best to trick them into getting compromised . Since the end of March up until the end of May 2019 , ESET observed that there were more than 50 victimized computers actively communicating with the C&C server . This extends to other countries in Latin America , with the Ecuadorean military being another organization highly targeted by Machete . Machete is malware that has been developed and is actively maintained by a Spanish-speaking group . Since it was active in 2012 , it has been carrying out attacks against sensitive targets in China and is one of the most active APT attack organizations targeting mainland China in recent years . By introducing small changes to their code and infrastructure , the group has bypassed several security products . OceanLotus will release malicious sub-packages in the background , receive the remote control command , steal the privacy information of users such as SMS messages , contacts , call records , geographic locations , and browser records . They also download apks secretly and record audios and videos , then upload users’ privacy information to server , causing users’ privacy leakage . It can be seen that after the code leakage , the CEO of the HackingTeam organization said that the leaked code is only a small part is based on the facts , which also reflects that the network arms merchants have lowered the threshold of APT attacks to a certain extent , making more uncertainties of cyber attacks . This report includes details related to the major hacking targets of the SectorJ04 group in 2019 , how those targets were hacked , characteristics of their hacking activities this year and recent cases of the SectorJ04 group’s hacking . In 2019 , the SectorJ04 group expanded its hacking activities to cover various industrial sectors located across Southeast Asia and East Asia , and is changing the pattern of their attacks from targeted attacks to searching for random victims . The SectorJ04 group has maintained the scope of its existing hacking activities while expanding its hacking activities to companies in various industrial sectors located in East Asia and Southeast Asia . There was a significant increase in SectorJ04's hacking activities in 2019 , especially those targeting South Korea . They mainly utilize spam email to deliver their backdoor to the infected system that can perform additional commands from the attacker’s server . We saw SectorJ04 group activity in Germany , Indonesia , the United States , Taiwan , India . The SectorJ04 group mainly utilizes a spear phishing email with MS Word or Excel files attached , and the document files downloads the Microsoft Installer (MSI) installation file from the attacker server and uses it to install backdoor on the infected system . The SectorJ04 group’s preexisting targets were financial institutions located in countries such as North America and Europe , or general companies such as retail and manufacturing , but they recently expanded their LOCs of activity to include the medical , pharmaceutical , media , energy and manufacturing industries . The SectorJ04 group mainly used their own backdoor , ServHelper and FlawedAmmy RAT , for hacking .",1,"APT41 has also deployed rootkits and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits on a limited basis to hide their malware and maintain persistence on select victim systems . The limited use of these tools by APT41 suggests the group reserves more advanced TTPs and malware only for high-value targets . Like other Chinese espionage operators , APT41 appears to have moved toward strategic intelligence collection and establishing access and aACT from direct intellectual property theft since 2015 . This shift , however , has not affected the group's consistent interest in targeting the video game industry for financially motivated reasons . BalkanRAT enables the attacker to remotely control the compromised computer via a graphical interface , i.e. , manually; BalkanDoor enables them to remotely control the compromised computer via a command line , i.e. , possibly en masse . With the contents of the emails , included links and decoy PDFs all involving taxes , the attackers are apparently targeting the financial departments of organizations in the Balkans region . Some parts of the campaign were briefly described by a Serbian security provider in 2016 and the Croatian CERT in 2017 . The campaign has been active at least from January 2016 to the time of writing the most recent detections in our telemetry are from July 2019 . Our findings show that the mentioned attacks have been orchestrated and we consider them a single long-term campaign that spans Croatia , Serbia , Montenegro , and Bosnia and Herzegovina . We’ve discovered a new version of BalkanDoor with a new method for execution/installation: an exploit of the WinRAR ACE vulnerability [CVE] . Both BalkanRAT and BalkanDoor spread in Croatia , Serbia , Montenegro , and Bosnia and Herzegovina . According to our telemetry , the campaign spreading these tools has been live since 2016 , with the most recent detections as late as in July 2019 . In some of the latest samples of BalkanDoor detected in 2019 , the malware is distributed as an ACE archive , disguised as a RAR archive (i.e. , not an executable file) , specially crafted to exploit the WinRAR ACE vulnerability [CVE] . Via the BalkanDoor backdoor , the attacker sends a backdoor command to unlock the screen… and using BalkanRAT , they can do whatever they want on the computer . The BalkanDoor backdoor does not implement any Exfiltration channel . APT41 leveraged ADORE.XSEC , a Linux backdoor launched by the Adore-NG rootkit , throughout an organization's Linux environment . The backdoor can connect to any of the C&Cs from a hardcoded list – a measure to increase resilience . The main part of the BalkanRAT malware is a copy of the Remote Utilities software for remote access . Interestingly , some of the APT41's POISONPLUG malware samples leverage the Steam Community website associated with Valve , a video game developer and publisher . The campaign targeting accountants in the Balkans shows some similarities with a campaign aimed at Ukrainian notaries reported in 2016 . Based on the Let’s Encrypt certificate issuance date , we believe this campaign to be active from May 2019 . One of the domains uncovered during the investigation was identified by the Chinese security vendor CERT 360 as being part of the BITTER APT campaign in May 2019 .

As part of its ongoing research initiatives , the Anomali Threat Research Team has discovered a new phishing attack leveraging spoof sites that seem to be designed to steal email credentials from the target victims within the government of the People’s Republic of China . 360 Threat Intelligence Center has reported on related indicators being attributed to BITTER APT a South Asian country suspected Indian APT in open source reporting . China Chopper is a tool that has been used by some state-sponsored actors such as Leviathan and Threat Group-3390 , but during our investigation we've seen actors with varying skill levels . China Chopper is a tool that allows attackers to remotely control the target system that needs to be running a web server application before it can be targeted by the tool . Cisco Talos discovered significant China Chopper activity over a two-year period beginning in June 2017 , which shows that even nine years after its creation , attackers are using China Chopper without significant modifications . Here , we investigate a campaign targeting an Asian government organization . We observed another campaign targeting an organisation located in Lebanon . China Chopper contains a remote shell ( Virtual Terminal ) function that has a first suggested command of netstat an|find ESTABLISHED . They download and install an archive containing executables and trivially modified source code of the password-stealing tool Mimikatz Lite as GetPassword.exe . The tool investigates the Local Security Authority Subsystem memory space in order to find , decrypt and display retrieved passwords . The actor attempts to exploit CVE-2018–8440 — an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows when it improperly handles calls to Advanced Local Procedure Call — to elevate the privileges using a modified proof-of-concept exploit . The attacker obtains the required privileges and launches a few other tools to modify the access control lists (ACLs) of all websites running on the affected server . The Windows branch of the Cloud Atlas intrusion set still uses spear-phishing emails to target high profile victims .

There was a significant increase in SectorJ04's hacking activities in 2019 , especially those targeting South Korea . They mainly utilize spam email to deliver their backdoor to the infected system that can perform additional commands from the attacker’s server . We saw SectorJ04 group activity in Germany , Indonesia , the United States , Taiwan , India . The SectorJ04 group mainly utilizes a spear phishing email with MS Word or Excel files attached , and the document files downloads the Microsoft Installer (MSI) installation file from the attacker server and uses it to install backdoor on the infected system . The SectorJ04 group’s preexisting targets were financial institutions located in countries such as North America and Europe , or general companies such as retail and manufacturing , but they recently expanded their LOCs of activity to include the medical , pharmaceutical , media , energy and manufacturing industries . The SectorJ04 group mainly used their own backdoor , ServHelper and FlawedAmmy RAT , for hacking ."

"Based on our research , SWEED — which has been operating since at least 2017 — primarily targets their victims with stealers and remote access trojans . It is interesting to note that Turla operators used the free email provider GMX again , as in the Outlook Backdoor and in LightNeuron . This new research confirms our forecast and shows that the Turla group does not hesitate to use open-source pen-testing frameworks to conduct intrusion . Neptun is installed on Microsoft Exchange servers and is designed to passively listen for commands from the attackers . One attack during this campaign involved the use of infrastructure belonging to another espionage group known as Crambus aka OilRig , APT34 . Waterbug has been using Meterpreter since at least early 2018 and , in this campaign , used a modified version of Meterpreter , which was encoded and given a .wav extension in order to disguise its true purpose . In all likelihood , Waterbug’s use of Crambus infrastructure appears to have been a hostile takeover . One of the most interesting things to occur during one of Waterbug’s recent campaigns was that during an attack against one target in the Middle East , Waterbug appeared to hijack infrastructure from the Crambus espionage group and used it to deliver malware on to the victim’s network . These three recent Waterbug campaigns have seen the group compromise governments and international organizations across the globe in addition to targets in the IT and education sectors . Curiously though , Waterbug also compromised other computers on the victim’s network using its own infrastructure . Symantec believes that the variant of Mimikatz used in this attack is unique to Waterbug . Aside from the attack involving Crambus infrastructure , this sample of Mimikatz has only been seen used in one other attack , against an education target in the UK in 2017 . The first observed evidence of Waterbug activity came on January 11 , 2018 , when a Waterbug-linked tool (a task scheduler named msfgi.exe ) was dropped on to a computer on the victim’s network . In the case of the attack against the Middle Eastern target , Crambus was the first group to compromise the victim’s network , with the earliest evidence of activity dating to November 2017 . Waterbug’s intrusions on the victim’s network continued for much of 2018 . Symantec did not observe the initial access point and the close timeframe between Waterbug observed activity on the victim’s network and its observed use of Crambus infrastructure suggests that Waterbug may have used the Crambus infrastructure as an initial access point .",1,"Based on our research , SWEED — which has been operating since at least 2017 — primarily targets their victims with stealers and remote access trojans .

"These include CVE-2010-3962 as part of an attack campaign in 2010 and CVE-2014-1776 in 2014 . Beginning in August 2016 , a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers began releasing tools it claimed to have originated from the Equation Group . Over the coming months , it progressively released more tools , until April 2017 , when it released a final , large cache of tools , including the DoublePulsar backdoor , the FuzzBunch framework , and the EternalBlue , EternalSynergy , and EternalRomance exploit tools . However , Buckeye had already been using some of these leaked tools at least a year beforehand . The earliest known use of Equation Group tools by Buckeye is March 31 , 2016 , during an attack on a target in Hong Kong . Beginning in March 2016 , Buckeye began using a variant of DoublePulsar (Backdoor.Doublepulsar) , a backdoor that was subsequently released by the Shadow Brokers in 2017 . However , while activity involving known Buckeye tools ceased in mid-2017 , the Bemstour exploit tool and the DoublePulsar variant used by Buckeye continued to be used until at least September 2018 in conjunction with different malware . During this attack , the Bemstour exploit tool was delivered to victims via known Buckeye malware (Backdoor.Pirpi) . One hour later , Bemstour was used against an educational institution in Belgium . Bemstour is specifically designed to deliver a variant of the DoublePulsar backdoor . DoublePulsar is then used to inject a secondary payload , which runs in memory only . A significantly improved variant of the Bemstour exploit tool was rolled out in September 2016 , when it was used in an attack against an educational institution in Hong Kong . When used against 32-bit targets , Bemstour still delivered the same DoublePulsar backdoor . Bemstour was used again in June 2017 in an attack against an organization in Luxembourg . Between June and September 2017 , Bemstour was also used against targets in the Philippines and Vietnam . Development of Bemstour has continued into 2019 . Unlike earlier attacks when Bemstour was delivered using Buckeye's Pirpi backdoor , in this attack Bemstour was delivered to the victim by a different backdoor Trojan (Backdoor.Filensfer) . The most recent sample of Bemstour seen by Symantec appears to have been compiled on March 23 , 2019 , eleven days after the zero-day vulnerability was patched by Microsoft . Filensfer is a family of malware that has been used in targeted attacks since at least 2013 . The zero-day vulnerability found and reported by Symantec (CVE-2019-0703) occurs due to the ACT the Windows SMB Server handles certain requests . While Symantec has never observed the use of Filensfer alongside any known Buckeye tools , information shared privately by another vendor included evidence of Filensfer being used in conjunction with known Buckeye malware (Backdoor.Pirpi) . CVE-2017-0143 was also used by two other exploit tools—EternalRomance and EternalSynergy—that were released as part of the Shadow Brokers leak in April 2017 . Buckeye's exploit tool , EternalRomance , as well as EternalSynergy , can exploit the CVE-2017-0143 message type confusion vulnerability to perform memory corruption on unpatched victim computers . In the case of the Buckeye exploit tool , the attackers exploited their own zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-0703) . It is noteworthy that the attackers never used the FuzzBunch framework in its attacks . FuzzBunch is a framework designed to manage DoublePulsar and other Equation Group tools and was leaked by the Shadow Brokers in 2017 . There are multiple possibilities as to how Buckeye obtained Equation Group tools before the Shadow Brokers leak . However , aside from the continued use of the tools , Symantec has found no other evidence suggesting Buckeye has retooled . this RTF exploits again the CVE-2017-1882 on eqnedt32.exe . And the dropper execute the iassvcs.exe to make a side loading and make the persistence . This IP is very interesting because it connects with tele.zyns.com and old infrastructures used by chinese APT or DDOS Chinese team against the ancient soviet republics . Over the past three years , Filensfer has been deployed against organizations in Luxembourg , Sweden , Italy , the UK , and the U.S . All zero-day exploits known , or suspected , to have been used by this group are for vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash . According to reports , the Philippines is the most exposed country in ASEAN to the cyberattacks known as advanced persistent threats , or APTs . Our analysis of this malware shows that it belongs to Hussarini , also known as Sarhust , a backdoor family that has been used actively in APT attacks targeting countries in the ASEAN region since 2014 . OutExtra.exe is a signed legitimate application from Microsoft named finder.exe . In addition to file-based protection , customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) service have received reports on Buckeye , which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group . However , in this attack , this file is used to load the Hussarini backdoor via DLL hijacking . Today , this malware is still actively being used against the Philippines . Hussarini was first mentioned in APT campaigns targeting the Philippines and Thailand in 2014 . Further analysis showed that the Iron cybercrime group used two main functions from HackingTeam's source in both IronStealer and Iron ransomware . Xagent” is the original filename Xagent.exe whereas seems to be the version of the worm . Xagent – A variant of JbossMiner Mining Worm” – a worm written in Python and compiled using PyInstaller for both Windows and Linux platforms . Its activities were traced back to 2010 in FireEye's 2013 report on operation Ke3chang – a cyberespionage campaign directed at diplomatic organizations in Europe . We have been tracking the malicious activities related to this threat actor and discovered a previously undocumented malware family with strong links to the Ke3chang group – a backdoor we named Okrum . Furthermore , from 2015 to 2019 , we detected new versions of known malware families attributed to the Ke3chang group – BS2005 backdoors from operation Ke3chang and the RoyalDNS malware , reported by NCC Group in 2018 . Ke3chang behind the attacks seemed to have a particular interest in Slovakia , where a big portion of the discovered malware samples was detected; Croatia , the Czech Republic and other countries were also affected . Our technical analysis of the malware used in these attacks showed close ties to BS2005 backdoors from operation Ke3chang , and to a related TidePool malware family discovered by Palo Alto Networks in 2016 that targeted Indian embassies across the globe . The story continued in late 2016 , when we discovered a new , previously unknown backdoor that we named Okrum . The malicious actors behind the Okrum malware were focused on the same targets in Slovakia that were previously targeted by Ketrican 2015 backdoors . We started connecting the dots when we discovered that the Okrum backdoor was used to drop a Ketrican backdoor , freshly compiled in 2017 . In 2017 , the same entities that were affected by the Okrum malware and by the 2015 Ketrican backdoors again became targets of the malicious actors . This time , the attackers used new versions of the RoyalDNS malware and a Ketrican 2017 backdoor . According to ESET telemetry , Okrum was first detected in December 2016 , and targeted diplomatic missions in Slovakia , Belgium , Chile , Guatemala and Brazil throughout 2017 . In addition to file-based protection , customers of the DeepSight has received reports on Buckeye , which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group . In 2018 , we discovered a new version of the Ketrican backdoor that featured some code improvements . According to our telemetry , Okrum was used to target diplomatic missions in Slovakia , Belgium , Chile , Guatemala , and Brazil , with the attackers showing a particular interest in Slovakia . Indeed , we have detected various external tools being abused by Okrum , such as a keylogger , tools for dumping passwords , or enumerating network sessions . The detection evasion techniques we observed in the Okrum malware include embedding the malicious payload within a legitimate PNG image , employing several anti-emulation and anti-sandbox tricks , as well as making frequent changes in implementation . The unnamed company makes products used in the military and aerospace industries , and the hackers could have been after commercial secrets or more traditional espionage , according to ClearSky , the cybersecurity firm that exposed the operation . North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has set ambitious economic goals , and some cybersecurity analysts have predicted he will unleash the Pyongyang-affiliated hackers to meet those deadlines by targeting multinational companies’ trade secrets . According to ClearSky , the suspected Lazarus operatives looked to leverage a vulnerability in outdated WinRAR file-archiving software that hackers have been exploiting since it was disclosed last month . This new Lotus Blossom campaign delivers a malicious RTF document posing as an ASEAN Defence Minister's Meeting (ADMM) directory (decoy) that also carries an executable (payload) embedded as an OLE object , the Elise backdoor . Just months after the APT32 watering hole activity against ASEAN-related websites was observed in Fall 2017 , this new activity clearly indicates the association (ASEAN) clearly remains a priority collection target in the region . Researchers implicated Lazarus Group because of digital clues including a malicious implant known as Rising Sun that has been attributed to the group . The attackers originally embedded an implant into the malicious document as a hypertext application (HTA) file , and then quickly moved to hide it in an image on a remote server and used obfuscated Visual Basic macros to launch the decoder script . Lazarus used the open-source tool Invoke-PSImage , released December 20 , to embed the PowerShell script into the image file . Once the script runs , it passes the decoded script from the image file to the Windows command line in a variable $x , which uses cmd.exe to execute the obfuscated script and run it via PowerShell . The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an alert about this activity on Jan. 24 2019 , warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization's domain names . In the Sea Turtle campaign , Talos was able to identify two distinct groups of victims . The first group , we identify as primary victims , includes national security organizations , ministries of foreign affairs , and prominent energy organizations . The threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign show clear signs of being highly capable and brazen in their endeavors . In most cases , threat actors typically stop or slow down their activities once their campaigns are publicly revealed . The threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign were successful in compromising entities by manipulating and falsifying DNS records at various levels in the domain name space . If an attacker was able to compromise an organization's network administrator credentials , the attacker would be able to change that particular organization's DNS records at will . If the attackers were able to obtain one of these EPP keys , they would be able to modify any DNS records that were managed by that particular registrar . Captured legitimate user credentials when users interacted with these actor - controlled servers . The diagram below illustrates how we believe the actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign used DNS hijacking to achieve their end goals . As of early 2019 , the only evidence of the spear-phishing threat vector came from a compromised organization's public disclosure . On January 4 , Packet Clearing House , which is not an Internet exchange point but rather is an NGO which provides support to Internet exchange points and the core of the domain name system , provided confirmation of this aspect of the actors’ tactics when it publicly revealed its internal DNS had been briefly hijacked as a consequence of the compromise at its domain registrar . During a typical incident , the actor would modify the NS records for the targeted organization , pointing users to a malicious DNS server that provided actor-controlled responses to all DNS queries . The next step for the actor was to build MitM servers that impersonated legitimate services to capture user credentials . In addition to the MitM server IP addresses published in previous reports , Talos identified 16 additional servers leveraged by the actor during the observed attacks . The attackers would then use the certificate on actor-controlled servers to perform additional MitM operations to harvest additional credentials . In some cases , the victims were redirected to these actor-controlled servers displaying the stolen certificate . One notable aspect of the campaign was the actors' ability to impersonate VPN applications , such as Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) products , to perform MitM attacks . At this time , we do not believe that the attackers found a new ASA exploit . Rather , they likely abused the trust relationship associated with the ASA's SSL certificate to harvest VPN credentials to gain remote access to the victim's network . As an example , DNS records indicate that a targeted domain resolved to an actor-controlled MitM server . In another case , the attackers were able to compromise NetNod , a non-profit , independent internet infrastructure organization based in Sweden . Using this access , the threat actors were able to manipulate the DNS records for sa1[.]dnsnode[.]net . This redirection allowed the attackers to harvest credentials of administrators who manage domains with the TLD of Saudi Arabia (.sa) . In one of the more recent campaigns on March 27 , 2019 , the threat actors targeted the Sweden-based consulting firm Cafax . We assess with high confidence that Sea Turtle was targeted in an attempt to re-establish access to the NetNod network , which was previously compromised by this threat actor . Obtaining access to this ccTLD registrars would have allowed attackers to hijack any domain that used those ccTLDs . These actors perform DNS hijacking through the use of actor-controlled name servers . Sea Turtle have been more aggressive in their pursuit targeting DNS registries and a number of registrars , including those that manage ccTLDs . These actors use Let's Encrypts , Comodo , Sectigo , and self-signed certificates in their MitM servers to gain the initial round of credentials . These actors have been more aggressive in their pursuit targeting DNS registries and a number of registrars , including those that manage ccTLDs . Once they have access to the network , they steal the organization's legitimate SSL certificate and use it on actor-controlled servers . we believe that the Sea Turtle campaign continues to be highly successful for several reasons . Had more ccTLDs implemented security features such as registrar locks , attackers would be unable to redirect the targeted domains . The attackers stole organizations' SSL certificates associated with security appliances such as ASA to obtain VPN credentials , allowing the actors to gain access to the targeted network . The threat actors were able to maintain long term persistent access to many of these networks by utilizing compromised credentials . Cisco Talos will continue to monitor Sea Turtle and work with our partners to understand the threat as it continues to evolve to ensure that our customers remain protected and the public is informed . If the user enables macro to open the xlsm file , it will then drop the legitimate script engine AutoHotkey along with a malicious script file . Create a link file in the startup folder for AutoHotkeyU32.exe , allowing the attack to persist even after a system restart . More importantly , one of these files also enables the download of TeamViewer , a remote access tool that gives threat actors remote control over the system . Such attacks highlight the need for caution before downloading files from unknown sources and enabling macro for files from unknown sources . The agency's hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities . By the end of 2016 , the CIA's hacking division , which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) , had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems , trojans , viruses , and other weaponized malware . Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016 , its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook . Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the Year Zero disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed , disarmed and published . These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America , Europe and the United States . The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell's 1984 , but Weeping Angel , developed by the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch (EDB) , which infests smart TVs , transforming them into covert microphones , is surely its most emblematic realization . After infestation , Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode , so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on . As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks . The CIA's Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones . Despite iPhone's minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016 , a specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest , control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS , such as iPads . The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom's MI5/BTSS . CIA's arsenal includes numerous local and remote zero days developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ , NSA , FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop . These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp , Signal , Telegram , Wiebo , Confide and Cloackman by hacking the smart phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied . The CIA also runs a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware . CIA's malware includes multiple local and remote weaponized zero days , air gap jumping viruses such as Hammer Drill which infects software distributed on CD/DVDs , infectors for removable media such as USBs , systems to hide data in images or in covert disk LOCs Brutal Kangaroo and to keep its malware infestations going . Many of these infection efforts are pulled together by the CIA's Automated Implant Branch (AIB) , which has developed several attack systems for automated infestation and control of CIA malware , such as Assassin and Medusa . The CIA has developed automated multi-platform malware attack and control systems covering Windows , Mac OS X , Solaris , Linux and more , such as EDB's HIVE and the related Cutthroat and Swindle tools , which are described in the examples section below . By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA ensures that it can hack everyone &mdsh; at the expense of leaving everyone hackable . Once in Frankfurt CIA hackers can travel without further border checks to the 25 European countries that are part of the Shengen open border LOC — including France , Italy and Switzerland . A number of the CIA's electronic attack methods are designed for physical proximity . The attacker is provided with a USB containing malware developed for the CIA for this purpose , which is inserted into the targeted computer . The attacker then infects and exfiltrates data to removable media . As an example , specific CIA malware revealed in Year Zero is able to penetrate , infest and control both the Android phone and iPhone software that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts . For example , the CIA attack system Fine Dining , provides 24 decoy applications for CIA spies to use . For example , Comodo was defeated by CIA malware placing itself in the Window's Recycle Bin . CIA hackers discussed what the NSA's Equation Group hackers did wrong and how the CIA's malware makers could avoid similar exposure . The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation . This information is used by the CIA's 'JQJIMPROVISE' software (see below) to configure a set of CIA malware suited to the specific needs of an operation . Its configuration utilities like Margarita allows the NOC (Network Operation Center) to customize tools based on requirements from 'Fine Dining' questionairies . HIVE is a multi-platform CIA malware suite and its associated control software . A series of standards lay out CIA malware infestation patterns which are likely to assist forensic crime scene investigators as well as Apple , Microsoft , Google , Samsung , Nokia , Blackberry , Siemens and anti-virus companies attribute and defend against attacks . In April 2013 , Kaspersky Lab reported that a popular game was altered to include a backdoor in 2011 . Yet again , new supply-chain attacks recently caught the attention of ESET Researchers . Given that these attacks were mostly targeted against Asia and the gaming industry , it shouldn’t be surprising they are the work of the group described in Kaspersky’s Winnti – More than just a game” . The OSB functions as the interface between CIA operational staff and the relevant technical support staff . A sustained cyberespionage campaign targeting at least three companies in the United States and Europe was uncovered by Recorded Future and Rapid7 between November 2017 and September 2018 . The Honeycomb toolserver receives exfiltrated information from the implant; an operator can also task the implant to execute jobs on the target computer , so the toolserver acts as a C2 (command and control) server for the implant . The attackers then enumerated access and conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks , utilizing DLL sideloading techniques documented in a US-CERT alert on APT10 to deliver malware . On the two other victim networks , the attackers deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor , known to have only been used by APT10 . APT10 actors then compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR (deployed by the attackers) and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool . UMBRAGE components cover keyloggers , password collection , webcam capture , data destruction , persistence , privilege escalation , stealth , anti-virus (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques . we assess with high confidence that these incidents were conducted by APT10 also known as Stone Panda , menuPass , CVNX in an effort to gain access to networks and steal valuable intellectual property or gain commercial advantage . On top of the breadth , volume , and targets of attacks that APT10 has conducted since at least 2016 , we now know that these operations are being run by the Chinese intelligence agency , the Ministry of State Security (MSS) . Utilizing actors working for shell companies such as Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co Ltd , the MSS has conducted an unprecedented campaign , dubbed Operation Cloud Hopper , ” against managed IT service providers (MSPs) designed to steal intellectual property and enable secondary attacks against their clients . We assess that APT10 likely compromised Visma with the primary goal of enabling secondary intrusions onto their client networks , and not of stealing Visma intellectual property . In this same time frame , APT10 also targeted a U.S. law firm and an international apparel company , likely to gather information for commercial advantage . The backdoor was deployed using the Notepad++ updater and sideloading malicious DLL , as noted in APT10’s targeting of Japanese corporations in July 2018 . That attack was attributed to perpetrators Kaspersky called the Winnti Group . APT10 is a threat actor that has been active since at least 2009 . APT10 has historically targeted healthcare , defense , aerospace , government , heavy industry and mining , and MSPs and IT services , as well as other sectors , for probable intellectual property theft . We believe APT10 is the most significant Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat to global corporations known to date . In the blog , Intrusion Truth identified APT10 as having utilized several Tianjin-based companies , including Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co. Ltd. and Laoying Baichen Instruments Equipment Co. Ltd . Based on the technical data uncovered , and in light of recent disclosures by the U.S. Department of Justice on the ongoing activities of Chinese state-sponsored threat actors . Our research from 2017 concluded that Guangdong ITSEC (and therefore the MSS) directed the activities of a company named Boyusec , which was identified as a shell company for APT3 . Access to the networks of these third-party service providers grants the MSS the ability to potentially access the networks of hundreds , if not thousands , of corporations around the world . The December APT10 indictment noted that the group’s malicious activities breached at least 45 companies and managed service providers in 12 countries , including Brazil , Canada , Finland , France , Germany , India , Japan , Sweden , Switzerland , the United Arab Emirates , the United Kingdom , and the United States . In all three incidents , APT10 gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials . In all three incidents , the attackers gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials . In all three incidents , APT10 actors used previously acquired legitimate credentials , possibly gained via a third-party supply chain compromise in order to gain initial access to the law firm and the apparel company . In early 2017 , APT10 began conducting attacks against global managed IT service providers (MSPs) that granted them unprecedented access to MSPs and their customers’ networks . 'Improvise' is a toolset for configuration , post-processing , payload setup and execution vector selection for survey/Exfiltration tools supporting all major operating systems like Windows (Bartender) , MacOS ( JukeBox ) and Linux ( DanceFloor ) . . During this operation (dubbed ‘Cloud Hopper” because of the group’s use of popular western cloud-based services) , APT10 utilized both new malware (Quasar RAT , Trochilus , RedLeaves , ChChes as well as some familiar old tools . Most recently , on December 20 , 2018 , the U.S. Department of Justice charged two hackers associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) with global computer intrusion campaigns targeting intellectual property . This indictment attributed the intrusions to APT10 , a group that had been conducting the malicious activities for over a decade on behalf of the MSS , China’s civilian human intelligence agency . The Visma group operates across the entire Nordic region along with Benelux , Central , and Eastern Europe . Recorded Future has actively tracked APT10 for several years , focusing specifically on the group’s targeting of MSPs and global internet infrastructure providers since the Operation Cloud Hopper report in 2017 . We were particularly interested in identifying whether any customers of the targeted MSPs were subsequently compromised by APT10 , given their potential access through compromised MSP networks . Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has actively tracked APT10 for several years , focusing specifically on the group’s targeting of MSPs and global internet infrastructure providers since the Operation Cloud Hopper report in 2017 . In September 2018 , one of our clients (and a supplier as well) , Visma , reached out to us for assistance in investigating an incident uncovered on their network following a breach notification by Rapid7 . This was followed by an initial exploitation , network enumeration , and malicious tool deployment on various Visma endpoints within two weeks of initial access . On August 30 , 2018 , APT10 deployed their first modified version of Trochilus that had its C2 communications encrypted using Salsa20 and RC4 ciphers instead of the more common RC4-encrypted Trochilus variant seen in the wild . This sample , similar to other Trochilus samples , was deployed using a DLL sideloading method utilizing three files , uploaded to the same folder on the victim machine as identified in US-CERT advisory TA17-117A last revised on December 20 , 2018 . The configuration file then loads the Trochilus payload into memory by injecting it into a valid system process . APT10 also used WinRAR and cURL for Windows , both often renamed , to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API . In order to exfiltrate the compromised data , APT10 employed custom malware that used Dropbox as its C2 . They also used WinRAR and cURL for Windows , both often renamed , to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API . Our research partner Rapid7 investigated the Dropbox use and found that the attackers had used the same account to store exfiltrated data from a global apparel company . They also identified broadly similar TTPs being used in the attack against a U.S. law firm specializing in intellectual property law . Rapid7’s investigation revealed the law firm was first targeted in late 2017 , followed by the apparel company a few months later , and finally , the Visma attack in August 2018 . In one of the attacks , Rapid7 identified the attackers escaping a Citrix application in order to run the payload script on the victim desktop . Additionally , the same DLL sideloading technique observed in the Visma attack was used , and many of the tools deployed by the APT10 shared naming similarities as well 1.bat , cu.exe , ss.rar , r.exe , pd.exe . Most interestingly , Rapid7 observed the use of the Notepad++ updater gup.exe as a legitimate executable to sideload a malicious DLL (libcurl.dll) in order to deploy a variant of the UPPERCUT backdoor also known as ANEL . APT10 used this approach to deploy UPPERCUT when targeting Japanese corporations in July 2018 . APT10 actors gained initial access to the Visma network around August 17 , 2018 . While we are confident that APT10 actors gained access to the Visma network in August using stolen employee Citrix remote desktop credentials , it is not clear how or when these credentials were initially compromised . Insikt Group analysis of network metadata to and from the VPN endpoint IPs revealed consistent connectivity to Citrix-hosted infrastructure from all eight VPN endpoint IPs starting on August 17 , 2018 — the same date the first authenticated login to Visma’s network was made using stolen credentials . After almost two weeks , on August 30 , 2018 , APT10 attackers used their access to the network to move laterally and made their first deployment of an RC4- and Salsa20-encrypted variant of the Trochilus malware using a previously associated DLL sideloading techniquE . This means that APT10 actors had two separate access points into the Visma network . This slight delay may point to the handing over of active exploitation duties to other operator(s) in a multi-team APT10 effort within the Ministry of State Security for the attack . Other examples of malicious infrastructure registered with internet.bs include domains for APT28’s VPNFilter malware campaign and the registration of the cyber-berkut . org domain that was affiliated with the pro-Russian and potentially Russian state-linked threat actor CyberBerkut . KHRAT is a backdoor trojan purported to be used with the China-linked cyberespionage group DragonOK . In early 2018 , Rapid7 identified that APT10 compromised an apparel company , based upon detections and intelligence gathered from the U.S.-based law firm breach . The attacker gained access to the victim’s internet-accessible Citrix systems and authenticated to them from networks associated with low-cost VPN providers owned by VPN Consumer Network . Rapid7 again observed APT10 dropping payloads named ccSEUPDT.exe.” The attackers used identical TTPs for executing malware and Mimikatz as observed before , by using DLL sideloading with known good binaries that had DLL search order path issues . Rapid7 reviewed malware discovered in the victim’s environment and found implants that used Dropbox as the C2 . The attackers used the same method of lateral movement by mounting the remote drive on a system , copying 1.bat to it , using task scheduler to execute the batch script , and finally , deleting the batch script . APT10 used the same method of lateral movement by mounting the remote drive on a system , copying 1.bat to it , using task scheduler to execute the batch script , and finally , deleting the batch script . For Exfiltration of stolen data , APT10 used WinRAR and renamed rar.exe” to r.exe” to create archives , upload them with curl.exe” (renamed to c.exe”) , and again , use the cloud storage provider Dropbox . Rapid7 discovered that additional data was placed into the Dropbox accounts under control of the attacker during the compromise and was able to attribute data that was placed into it as being owned by Visma . Once on the Visma network , APT10 attackers used the Microsoft BITSAdmin CLI tool to copy malicious tools from a suspected attacker-controlled C2 hosted on 173.254.236[.]158 to the \ProgramData\temp\ directory on the infected host . Rapid7 then provided a breach notification to Visma to alert them to this compromise in September 2018 . We believe APT10 is the most significant known Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat to global corporations . APT10's unprecedented campaign against MSPs , alleged to have included some of the largest MSPs in the world , in order to conduct secondary attacks against their clients , grants the Chinese state the ability to potentially access the networks of hundreds (if not thousands) of corporations around the world . This campaign brings to light further evidence supporting the assertions made by the Five Eyes nations , led by the U.S. Department of Justice indictment against APT10 actors outlining the unprecedented scale of economic cyberespionage being conducted by the Chinese Ministry of State Security . This report , alongside the plethora of other reporting on APT10 operations , acutely highlights the vulnerability of organizational supply chains .",1,"These include [CVE] as part of an attack campaign in 2010 and [CVE] in 2014 . Beginning in August 2016 , a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers began releasing tools it claimed to have originated from the Equation Group . Over the coming months , it progressively released more tools , until April 2017 , when it released a final , large cache of tools , including the DoublePulsar backdoor , the FuzzBunch framework , and the EternalBlue , EternalSynergy , and EternalRomance exploit tools . However , Buckeye had already been using some of these leaked tools at least a year beforehand . The earliest known use of Equation Group tools by Buckeye is March 31 , 2016 , during an attack on a target in Hong Kong . Beginning in March 2016 , Buckeye began using a variant of DoublePulsar (Backdoor.Doublepulsar) , a backdoor that was subsequently released by the Shadow Brokers in 2017 . However , while activity involving known Buckeye tools ceased in mid-2017 , the Bemstour exploit tool and the DoublePulsar variant used by Buckeye continued to be used until at least September 2018 in conjunction with different malware . During this attack , the Bemstour exploit tool was delivered to victims via known Buckeye malware (Backdoor.Pirpi) . One hour later , Bemstour was used against an educational institution in Belgium . Bemstour is specifically designed to deliver a variant of the DoublePulsar backdoor . DoublePulsar is then used to inject a secondary payload , which runs in memory only . A significantly improved variant of the Bemstour exploit tool was rolled out in September 2016 , when it was used in an attack against an educational institution in Hong Kong . When used against 32-bit targets , Bemstour still delivered the same DoublePulsar backdoor . Bemstour was used again in June 2017 in an attack against an organization in Luxembourg . Between June and September 2017 , Bemstour was also used against targets in the Philippines and Vietnam . Development of Bemstour has continued into 2019 . Unlike earlier attacks when Bemstour was delivered using Buckeye's Pirpi backdoor , in this attack Bemstour was delivered to the victim by a different backdoor Trojan (Backdoor.Filensfer) . The most recent sample of Bemstour seen by Symantec appears to have been compiled on March 23 , 2019 , eleven days after the zero-day vulnerability was patched by Microsoft . Filensfer is a family of malware that has been used in targeted attacks since at least 2013 . The zero-day vulnerability found and reported by Symantec ([CVE]) occurs due to the ACT the Windows SMB Server handles certain requests . While Symantec has never observed the use of Filensfer alongside any known Buckeye tools , information shared privately by another vendor included evidence of Filensfer being used in conjunction with known Buckeye malware (Backdoor.Pirpi) . [CVE] was also used by two other exploit tools—EternalRomance and EternalSynergy—that were released as part of the Shadow Brokers leak in April 2017 . Buckeye's exploit tool , EternalRomance , as well as EternalSynergy , can exploit the [CVE] message type confusion vulnerability to perform memory corruption on unpatched victim computers . In the case of the Buckeye exploit tool , the attackers exploited their own zero-day vulnerability ([CVE]) . It is noteworthy that the attackers never used the FuzzBunch framework in its attacks . FuzzBunch is a framework designed to manage DoublePulsar and other Equation Group tools and was leaked by the Shadow Brokers in 2017 . There are multiple possibilities as to how Buckeye obtained Equation Group tools before the Shadow Brokers leak . However , aside from the continued use of the tools , Symantec has found no other evidence suggesting Buckeye has retooled . this RTF exploits again the [CVE] on eqnedt32.exe . And the dropper execute the iassvcs.exe to make a side loading and make the persistence . This IP is very interesting because it connects with [DOMAIN] and old infrastructures used by chinese APT or DDOS Chinese team against the ancient soviet republics . Over the past three years , Filensfer has been deployed against organizations in Luxembourg , Sweden , Italy , the UK , and the U.S . All zero-day exploits known , or suspected , to have been used by this group are for vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash . According to reports , the Philippines is the most exposed country in ASEAN to the cyberattacks known as advanced persistent threats , or APTs . Our analysis of this malware shows that it belongs to Hussarini , also known as Sarhust , a backdoor family that has been used actively in APT attacks targeting countries in the ASEAN region since 2014 . OutExtra.exe is a signed legitimate application from Microsoft named finder.exe . In addition to file-based protection , customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) service have received reports on Buckeye , which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group . However , in this attack , this file is used to load the Hussarini backdoor via DLL hijacking . Today , this malware is still actively being used against the Philippines . Hussarini was first mentioned in APT campaigns targeting the Philippines and Thailand in 2014 . Further analysis showed that the Iron cybercrime group used two main functions from HackingTeam's source in both IronStealer and Iron ransomware . Xagent” is the original filename Xagent.exe whereas seems to be the version of the worm . Xagent – A variant of JbossMiner Mining Worm” – a worm written in Python and compiled using PyInstaller for both Windows and Linux platforms . Its activities were traced back to 2010 in FireEye's 2013 report on operation Ke3chang – a cyberespionage campaign directed at diplomatic organizations in Europe . We have been tracking the malicious activities related to this threat actor and discovered a previously undocumented malware family with strong links to the Ke3chang group – a backdoor we named Okrum . Furthermore , from 2015 to 2019 , we detected new versions of known malware families attributed to the Ke3chang group – BS2005 backdoors from operation Ke3chang and the RoyalDNS malware , reported by NCC Group in 2018 . Ke3chang behind the attacks seemed to have a particular interest in Slovakia , where a big portion of the discovered malware samples was detected; Croatia , the Czech Republic and other countries were also affected . Our technical analysis of the malware used in these attacks showed close ties to BS2005 backdoors from operation Ke3chang , and to a related TidePool malware family discovered by Palo Alto Networks in 2016 that targeted Indian embassies across the globe . The story continued in late 2016 , when we discovered a new , previously unknown backdoor that we named Okrum . The malicious actors behind the Okrum malware were focused on the same targets in Slovakia that were previously targeted by Ketrican 2015 backdoors . We started connecting the dots when we discovered that the Okrum backdoor was used to drop a Ketrican backdoor , freshly compiled in 2017 . In 2017 , the same entities that were affected by the Okrum malware and by the 2015 Ketrican backdoors again became targets of the malicious actors . This time , the attackers used new versions of the RoyalDNS malware and a Ketrican 2017 backdoor . According to ESET telemetry , Okrum was first detected in December 2016 , and targeted diplomatic missions in Slovakia , Belgium , Chile , Guatemala and Brazil throughout 2017 . In addition to file-based protection , customers of the DeepSight has received reports on Buckeye , which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group . In 2018 , we discovered a new version of the Ketrican backdoor that featured some code improvements . According to our telemetry , Okrum was used to target diplomatic missions in Slovakia , Belgium , Chile , Guatemala , and Brazil , with the attackers showing a particular interest in Slovakia . Indeed , we have detected various external tools being abused by Okrum , such as a keylogger , tools for dumping passwords , or enumerating network sessions . The detection evasion techniques we observed in the Okrum malware include embedding the malicious payload within a legitimate PNG image , employing several anti-emulation and anti-sandbox tricks , as well as making frequent changes in implementation . The unnamed company makes products used in the military and aerospace industries , and the hackers could have been after commercial secrets or more traditional espionage , according to ClearSky , the cybersecurity firm that exposed the operation . North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has set ambitious economic goals , and some cybersecurity analysts have predicted he will unleash the Pyongyang-affiliated hackers to meet those deadlines by targeting multinational companies’ trade secrets . According to ClearSky , the suspected Lazarus operatives looked to leverage a vulnerability in outdated WinRAR file-archiving software that hackers have been exploiting since it was disclosed last month . This new Lotus Blossom campaign delivers a malicious RTF document posing as an ASEAN Defence Minister's Meeting (ADMM) directory (decoy) that also carries an executable (payload) embedded as an OLE object , the Elise backdoor . Just months after the APT32 watering hole activity against ASEAN-related websites was observed in Fall 2017 , this new activity clearly indicates the association (ASEAN) clearly remains a priority collection target in the region . Researchers implicated Lazarus Group because of digital clues including a malicious implant known as Rising Sun that has been attributed to the group . The attackers originally embedded an implant into the malicious document as a hypertext application (HTA) file , and then quickly moved to hide it in an image on a remote server and used obfuscated Visual Basic macros to launch the decoder script . Lazarus used the open-source tool Invoke-PSImage , released December 20 , to embed the PowerShell script into the image file . Once the script runs , it passes the decoded script from the image file to the Windows command line in a variable $x , which uses cmd.exe to execute the obfuscated script and run it via PowerShell . The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an alert about this activity on Jan. 24 2019 , warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization's domain names . In the Sea Turtle campaign , Talos was able to identify two distinct groups of victims . The first group , we identify as primary victims , includes national security organizations , ministries of foreign affairs , and prominent energy organizations . The threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign show clear signs of being highly capable and brazen in their endeavors . In most cases , threat actors typically stop or slow down their activities once their campaigns are publicly revealed . The threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign were successful in compromising entities by manipulating and falsifying DNS records at various levels in the domain name space . If an attacker was able to compromise an organization's network administrator credentials , the attacker would be able to change that particular organization's DNS records at will . If the attackers were able to obtain one of these EPP keys , they would be able to modify any DNS records that were managed by that particular registrar . Captured legitimate user credentials when users interacted with these actor - controlled servers . The diagram below illustrates how we believe the actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign used DNS hijacking to achieve their end goals . As of early 2019 , the only evidence of the spear-phishing threat vector came from a compromised organization's public disclosure . On January 4 , Packet Clearing House , which is not an Internet exchange point but rather is an NGO which provides support to Internet exchange points and the core of the domain name system , provided confirmation of this aspect of the actors’ tactics when it publicly revealed its internal DNS had been briefly hijacked as a consequence of the compromise at its domain registrar . During a typical incident , the actor would modify the NS records for the targeted organization , pointing users to a malicious DNS server that provided actor-controlled responses to all DNS queries . The next step for the actor was to build MitM servers that impersonated legitimate services to capture user credentials . In addition to the MitM server IP addresses published in previous reports , Talos identified 16 additional servers leveraged by the actor during the observed attacks . The attackers would then use the certificate on actor-controlled servers to perform additional MitM operations to harvest additional credentials . In some cases , the victims were redirected to these actor-controlled servers displaying the stolen certificate . One notable aspect of the campaign was the actors' ability to impersonate VPN applications , such as Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) products , to perform MitM attacks . At this time , we do not believe that the attackers found a new ASA exploit . Rather , they likely abused the trust relationship associated with the ASA's SSL certificate to harvest VPN credentials to gain remote access to the victim's network . As an example , DNS records indicate that a targeted domain resolved to an actor-controlled MitM server . In another case , the attackers were able to compromise NetNod , a non-profit , independent internet infrastructure organization based in Sweden . Using this access , the threat actors were able to manipulate the DNS records for sa1[.]dnsnode[.]net . This redirection allowed the attackers to harvest credentials of administrators who manage domains with the TLD of Saudi Arabia (.sa) . In one of the more recent campaigns on March 27 , 2019 , the threat actors targeted the Sweden-based consulting firm Cafax . We assess with high confidence that Sea Turtle was targeted in an attempt to re-establish access to the NetNod network , which was previously compromised by this threat actor . Obtaining access to this ccTLD registrars would have allowed attackers to hijack any domain that used those ccTLDs . These actors perform DNS hijacking through the use of actor-controlled name servers . Sea Turtle have been more aggressive in their pursuit targeting DNS registries and a number of registrars , including those that manage ccTLDs . These actors use Let's Encrypts , Comodo , Sectigo , and self-signed certificates in their MitM servers to gain the initial round of credentials . These actors have been more aggressive in their pursuit targeting DNS registries and a number of registrars , including those that manage ccTLDs . Once they have access to the network , they steal the organization's legitimate SSL certificate and use it on actor-controlled servers . we believe that the Sea Turtle campaign continues to be highly successful for several reasons . Had more ccTLDs implemented security features such as registrar locks , attackers would be unable to redirect the targeted domains . The attackers stole organizations' SSL certificates associated with security appliances such as ASA to obtain VPN credentials , allowing the actors to gain access to the targeted network . The threat actors were able to maintain long term persistent access to many of these networks by utilizing compromised credentials . Cisco Talos will continue to monitor Sea Turtle and work with our partners to understand the threat as it continues to evolve to ensure that our customers remain protected and the public is informed . If the user enables macro to open the xlsm file , it will then drop the legitimate script engine AutoHotkey along with a malicious script file . Create a link file in the startup folder for AutoHotkeyU32.exe , allowing the attack to persist even after a system restart . More importantly , one of these files also enables the download of TeamViewer , a remote access tool that gives threat actors remote control over the system . Such attacks highlight the need for caution before downloading files from unknown sources and enabling macro for files from unknown sources . The agency's hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities . By the end of 2016 , the CIA's hacking division , which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) , had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems , trojans , viruses , and other weaponized malware . Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016 , its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook . Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the Year Zero disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed , disarmed and published . These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America , Europe and the United States . The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell's 1984 , but Weeping Angel , developed by the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch (EDB) , which infests smart TVs , transforming them into covert microphones , is surely its most emblematic realization . After infestation , Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode , so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on . As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks . The CIA's Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones . Despite iPhone's minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016 , a specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest , control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS , such as iPads . The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom's MI5/BTSS . CIA's arsenal includes numerous local and remote zero days developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ , NSA , FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop . These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp , Signal , Telegram , Wiebo , Confide and Cloackman by hacking the smart phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied . The CIA also runs a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware . CIA's malware includes multiple local and remote weaponized zero days , air gap jumping viruses such as Hammer Drill which infects software distributed on CD/DVDs , infectors for removable media such as USBs , systems to hide data in images or in covert disk LOCs Brutal Kangaroo and to keep its malware infestations going . Many of these infection efforts are pulled together by the CIA's Automated Implant Branch (AIB) , which has developed several attack systems for automated infestation and control of CIA malware , such as Assassin and Medusa . The CIA has developed automated multi-platform malware attack and control systems covering Windows , Mac OS X , Solaris , Linux and more , such as EDB's HIVE and the related Cutthroat and Swindle tools , which are described in the examples section below . By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA ensures that it can hack everyone &mdsh; at the expense of leaving everyone hackable . Once in Frankfurt CIA hackers can travel without further border checks to the 25 European countries that are part of the Shengen open border LOC — including France , Italy and Switzerland . A number of the CIA's electronic attack methods are designed for physical proximity . The attacker is provided with a USB containing malware developed for the CIA for this purpose , which is inserted into the targeted computer . The attacker then infects and exfiltrates data to removable media . As an example , specific CIA malware revealed in Year Zero is able to penetrate , infest and control both the Android phone and iPhone software that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts . For example , the CIA attack system Fine Dining , provides 24 decoy applications for CIA spies to use . For example , Comodo was defeated by CIA malware placing itself in the Window's Recycle Bin . CIA hackers discussed what the NSA's Equation Group hackers did wrong and how the CIA's malware makers could avoid similar exposure . The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation . This information is used by the CIA's 'JQJIMPROVISE' software (see below) to configure a set of CIA malware suited to the specific needs of an operation . Its configuration utilities like Margarita allows the NOC (Network Operation Center) to customize tools based on requirements from 'Fine Dining' questionairies . HIVE is a multi-platform CIA malware suite and its associated control software . A series of standards lay out CIA malware infestation patterns which are likely to assist forensic crime scene investigators as well as Apple , Microsoft , Google , Samsung , Nokia , Blackberry , Siemens and anti-virus companies attribute and defend against attacks . In April 2013 , Kaspersky Lab reported that a popular game was altered to include a backdoor in 2011 . Yet again , new supply-chain attacks recently caught the attention of ESET Researchers . Given that these attacks were mostly targeted against Asia and the gaming industry , it shouldn’t be surprising they are the work of the group described in Kaspersky’s Winnti – More than just a game” . The OSB functions as the interface between CIA operational staff and the relevant technical support staff . A sustained cyberespionage campaign targeting at least three companies in the United States and Europe was uncovered by Recorded Future and Rapid7 between November 2017 and September 2018 . The Honeycomb toolserver receives exfiltrated information from the implant; an operator can also task the implant to execute jobs on the target computer , so the toolserver acts as a C2 (command and control) server for the implant . The attackers then enumerated access and conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks , utilizing DLL sideloading techniques documented in a US-CERT alert on APT10 to deliver malware . On the two other victim networks , the attackers deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor , known to have only been used by APT10 . APT10 actors then compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR (deployed by the attackers) and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool . UMBRAGE components cover keyloggers , password collection , webcam capture , data destruction , persistence , privilege escalation , stealth , anti-virus (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques . we assess with high confidence that these incidents were conducted by APT10 also known as Stone Panda , menuPass , CVNX in an effort to gain access to networks and steal valuable intellectual property or gain commercial advantage . On top of the breadth , volume , and targets of attacks that APT10 has conducted since at least 2016 , we now know that these operations are being run by the Chinese intelligence agency , the Ministry of State Security (MSS) . Utilizing actors working for shell companies such as Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co Ltd , the MSS has conducted an unprecedented campaign , dubbed Operation Cloud Hopper , ” against managed IT service providers (MSPs) designed to steal intellectual property and enable secondary attacks against their clients . We assess that APT10 likely compromised Visma with the primary goal of enabling secondary intrusions onto their client networks , and not of stealing Visma intellectual property . In this same time frame , APT10 also targeted a U.S. law firm and an international apparel company , likely to gather information for commercial advantage . The backdoor was deployed using the Notepad++ updater and sideloading malicious DLL , as noted in APT10’s targeting of Japanese corporations in July 2018 . That attack was attributed to perpetrators Kaspersky called the Winnti Group . APT10 is a threat actor that has been active since at least 2009 . APT10 has historically targeted healthcare , defense , aerospace , government , heavy industry and mining , and MSPs and IT services , as well as other sectors , for probable intellectual property theft . We believe APT10 is the most significant Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat to global corporations known to date . In the blog , Intrusion Truth identified APT10 as having utilized several Tianjin-based companies , including Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co. Ltd. and Laoying Baichen Instruments Equipment Co. Ltd . Based on the technical data uncovered , and in light of recent disclosures by the U.S. Department of Justice on the ongoing activities of Chinese state-sponsored threat actors . Our research from 2017 concluded that Guangdong ITSEC (and therefore the MSS) directed the activities of a company named Boyusec , which was identified as a shell company for APT3 . Access to the networks of these third-party service providers grants the MSS the ability to potentially access the networks of hundreds , if not thousands , of corporations around the world . The December APT10 indictment noted that the group’s malicious activities breached at least 45 companies and managed service providers in 12 countries , including Brazil , Canada , Finland , France , Germany , India , Japan , Sweden , Switzerland , the United Arab Emirates , the United Kingdom , and the United States . In all three incidents , APT10 gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials . In all three incidents , the attackers gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials . In all three incidents , APT10 actors used previously acquired legitimate credentials , possibly gained via a third-party supply chain compromise in order to gain initial access to the law firm and the apparel company . In early 2017 , APT10 began conducting attacks against global managed IT service providers (MSPs) that granted them unprecedented access to MSPs and their customers’ networks . 'Improvise' is a toolset for configuration , post-processing , payload setup and execution vector selection for survey/Exfiltration tools supporting all major operating systems like Windows (Bartender) , MacOS ( JukeBox ) and Linux ( DanceFloor ) . . During this operation (dubbed ‘Cloud Hopper” because of the group’s use of popular western cloud-based services) , APT10 utilized both new malware (Quasar RAT , Trochilus , RedLeaves , ChChes as well as some familiar old tools . Most recently , on December 20 , 2018 , the U.S. Department of Justice charged two hackers associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) with global computer intrusion campaigns targeting intellectual property . This indictment attributed the intrusions to APT10 , a group that had been conducting the malicious activities for over a decade on behalf of the MSS , China’s civilian human intelligence agency . The Visma group operates across the entire Nordic region along with Benelux , Central , and Eastern Europe . Recorded Future has actively tracked APT10 for several years , focusing specifically on the group’s targeting of MSPs and global internet infrastructure providers since the Operation Cloud Hopper report in 2017 . We were particularly interested in identifying whether any customers of the targeted MSPs were subsequently compromised by APT10 , given their potential access through compromised MSP networks . Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has actively tracked APT10 for several years , focusing specifically on the group’s targeting of MSPs and global internet infrastructure providers since the Operation Cloud Hopper report in 2017 . In September 2018 , one of our clients (and a supplier as well) , Visma , reached out to us for assistance in investigating an incident uncovered on their network following a breach notification by Rapid7 . This was followed by an initial exploitation , network enumeration , and malicious tool deployment on various Visma endpoints within two weeks of initial access . On August 30 , 2018 , APT10 deployed their first modified version of Trochilus that had its C2 communications encrypted using Salsa20 and RC4 ciphers instead of the more common RC4-encrypted Trochilus variant seen in the wild . This sample , similar to other Trochilus samples , was deployed using a DLL sideloading method utilizing three files , uploaded to the same folder on the victim machine as identified in US-CERT advisory TA17-117A last revised on December 20 , 2018 . The configuration file then loads the Trochilus payload into memory by injecting it into a valid system process . APT10 also used WinRAR and cURL for Windows , both often renamed , to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API . In order to exfiltrate the compromised data , APT10 employed custom malware that used Dropbox as its C2 . They also used WinRAR and cURL for Windows , both often renamed , to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API . Our research partner Rapid7 investigated the Dropbox use and found that the attackers had used the same account to store exfiltrated data from a global apparel company . They also identified broadly similar TTPs being used in the attack against a U.S. law firm specializing in intellectual property law . Rapid7’s investigation revealed the law firm was first targeted in late 2017 , followed by the apparel company a few months later , and finally , the Visma attack in August 2018 . In one of the attacks , Rapid7 identified the attackers escaping a Citrix application in order to run the payload script on the victim desktop . Additionally , the same DLL sideloading technique observed in the Visma attack was used , and many of the tools deployed by the APT10 shared naming similarities as well 1.bat , cu.exe , ss.rar , r.exe , pd.exe . Most interestingly , Rapid7 observed the use of the Notepad++ updater gup.exe as a legitimate executable to sideload a malicious DLL (libcurl.dll) in order to deploy a variant of the UPPERCUT backdoor also known as ANEL . APT10 used this approach to deploy UPPERCUT when targeting Japanese corporations in July 2018 . APT10 actors gained initial access to the Visma network around August 17 , 2018 . While we are confident that APT10 actors gained access to the Visma network in August using stolen employee Citrix remote desktop credentials , it is not clear how or when these credentials were initially compromised . Insikt Group analysis of network metadata to and from the VPN endpoint IPs revealed consistent connectivity to Citrix-hosted infrastructure from all eight VPN endpoint IPs starting on August 17 , 2018 — the same date the first authenticated login to Visma’s network was made using stolen credentials . After almost two weeks , on August 30 , 2018 , APT10 attackers used their access to the network to move laterally and made their first deployment of an RC4- and Salsa20-encrypted variant of the Trochilus malware using a previously associated DLL sideloading techniquE . This means that APT10 actors had two separate access points into the Visma network . This slight delay may point to the handing over of active exploitation duties to other operator(s) in a multi-team APT10 effort within the Ministry of State Security for the attack . Other examples of malicious infrastructure registered with internet.bs include domains for APT28’s VPNFilter malware campaign and the registration of the cyber-berkut . org domain that was affiliated with the pro-Russian and potentially Russian state-linked threat actor CyberBerkut . KHRAT is a backdoor trojan purported to be used with the China-linked cyberespionage group DragonOK . In early 2018 , Rapid7 identified that APT10 compromised an apparel company , based upon detections and intelligence gathered from the U.S.-based law firm breach . The attacker gained access to the victim’s internet-accessible Citrix systems and authenticated to them from networks associated with low-cost VPN providers owned by VPN Consumer Network . Rapid7 again observed APT10 dropping payloads named ccSEUPDT.exe.” The attackers used identical TTPs for executing malware and Mimikatz as observed before , by using DLL sideloading with known good binaries that had DLL search order path issues . Rapid7 reviewed malware discovered in the victim’s environment and found implants that used Dropbox as the C2 . The attackers used the same method of lateral movement by mounting the remote drive on a system , copying 1.bat to it , using task scheduler to execute the batch script , and finally , deleting the batch script . APT10 used the same method of lateral movement by mounting the remote drive on a system , copying 1.bat to it , using task scheduler to execute the batch script , and finally , deleting the batch script . For Exfiltration of stolen data , APT10 used WinRAR and renamed rar.exe” to r.exe” to create archives , upload them with curl.exe” (renamed to c.exe”) , and again , use the cloud storage provider Dropbox . Rapid7 discovered that additional data was placed into the Dropbox accounts under control of the attacker during the compromise and was able to attribute data that was placed into it as being owned by Visma . Once on the Visma network , APT10 attackers used the Microsoft BITSAdmin CLI tool to copy malicious tools from a suspected attacker-controlled C2 hosted on 173.254.236[.]158 to the \ProgramData\temp\ directory on the infected host . Rapid7 then provided a breach notification to Visma to alert them to this compromise in September 2018 . We believe APT10 is the most significant known Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat to global corporations . APT10's unprecedented campaign against MSPs , alleged to have included some of the largest MSPs in the world , in order to conduct secondary attacks against their clients , grants the Chinese state the ability to potentially access the networks of hundreds (if not thousands) of corporations around the world . This campaign brings to light further evidence supporting the assertions made by the Five Eyes nations , led by the U.S. Department of Justice indictment against APT10 actors outlining the unprecedented scale of economic cyberespionage being conducted by the Chinese Ministry of State Security . This report , alongside the plethora of other reporting on APT10 operations , acutely highlights the vulnerability of organizational supply chains ."
